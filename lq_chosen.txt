Then maybe they would BOTH grab your hand!!!! Good Luck', "Charm her girlfriends to leave, or ask one of your friends to intervene. When she is scared she might grab your hand by mistake, then say a line to let her know u don't mind her doing that", 'Make sure no one sits next to her except you!!!', "Most girls don't grab STRANGERS hands when watching a scary movie......Make yourself known.  Introduce yourself, DON'T BE A STRANGER.  Get to know her and make her feel comfortable around you.  Next thing you know she might be usingyou as a shield for the movie screen.", 'lol...be a friend to her just like the other firend?...or touch her sometime...but non chalantly...so you guys get in this comfortable touching zone...talk to her and grab her hand and look at her ring and say i like that or somethign...long as you do it smooth and not clumsy...something of that nature...an then weigh her reaction out...if she looks weirded out by you touching her dont do it anymore...and try to use charm and friendly smiles when talkin to her...', 'Say something to her like, "I get frightened easily. Can I hold your hand at the scary parts?"\n\nOr make sure her friend isn\'t there next time.', 'Get her drunk.', 'be her best friend and more', "when you go on a date don't bring her friends along.", "Bro... You've got to take things one step at a time. Allow her to get to know you. Once she is comfortable with your companionship, you will see the difference. But never take advantage of the situation. God bless."], 'title': 'how do i get her to do this?'}
