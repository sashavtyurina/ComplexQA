QUESTION: why is my 5 month old pit bull puppy eating rocks? my dog is very active and has a really good appetite. she loves to play and is very well mannered. lately she has been eating small pea gravel from my landscaping. is she just being a puppy or is something wrong?

ANSWER: nothing wrong, but you shouldn't let her eat that. Its not like they are nutrious or anything. DIET!! something is missing!! change food!! maybe you might want to keep your dog inside and see a vet it may be mental or it is starving cause it doesn't like the food.Also in courage it to eat food and not eat rocks It's trying to show you it's intelligence level. The only thing stupider then dogs are the people who own them! THIS IS NORMAL FOR DOGS TO DO...BUT I WOULD IF I WAS YOU KEEP HER FROM DOINGING THIS BC IF TO MANY IN HER TUMMY SHE WONT BE ABLE TO PASS THEM OUT AND IT COULD RIP HER TUMMY AND BUM.....AND THEN YOUR LOOKING AT ALOT OF MONEY....JAY AKA PITA Well there you go! I would make sure you have lots of stuff for her to chew! Puppies need to gnaw on stuff all the time. I found this out the hard way, when my dog chewed off the handles of my screwdrivers and other things. Try raw hide chews and many other kinds at a pet store near you! naw naw dont worry cuz is. they grow up and their teeth is start to develop up and they feel an comforable when their teeth is in their mouth especially at that ages...and they will chew soem wierd stuff liek my dog i let him choose either is the shovel or hamburger toy he choose the shovel and can chew on it for hour and hour.....they wierd Don't want to scare you but I had a Golden Retriever doing that and ended up with a foot of stones in her intestine.  Went into shock and needed major surgery.  If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work. I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.

My own dog used to eat all our slippers and regurgitate them later on. The best thing is to keep your dog away from small items and give them safe chew toys to help them through it. 

Still, it could be something entirely different...calling up your vet might not be such a bad idea. Your dog might be teething. The hardness of the rocks probably feels good on her new teeth. You probably shouldn't let her eat them though. No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots. You still shouldn't let her eat it though. Trust me  we have a 6 month old boxer pup. He takes red hot pieces of coal out of the fire and then barks at them when they burn his mouth. Trust me. Puppies don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. Monst puppies teath until about 6-7 months so she is only doing that because she still has her baby teeth and thats what puppys do, they chew oon things alot. but don't let her she will get sick, very sick, trust me i'd know some dogs are prone to eat things they shouldn't ....don't allow her to eat them....you should be able to control the puppy...if not you will have a problem dog on your hands. She is just being a puppy.  Make sure she doesn't choke on or swallow any of the gravel.

If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work. I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.

My own dog used to eat all our slippers and regurgitate them later on. The best thing is to keep your dog away from small items and give them safe chew toys to help them through it. 

Still, it could be something entirely different...calling up your vet might not be such a bad idea. Your dog might be teething. The hardness of the rocks probably feels good on her new teeth. You probably shouldn't let her eat them though. No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots. You still shouldn't let her eat it though. Trust me  we have a 6 month old boxer pup. He takes red hot pieces of coal out of the fire and then barks at them when they burn his mouth. Trust me. Puppies don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. Monst puppies teath until about 6-7 months so she is only doing that because she still has her baby teeth and thats what puppys do, they chew oon things alot. but don't let her she will get sick, very sick, trust me i'd know some dogs are prone to eat things they shouldn't ....don't allow her to eat them....you should be able to control the puppy...if not you will have a problem dog on your hands. She is just being a puppy.  Make sure she doesn't choke on or swallow any of the gravel. 

QUESTION: why is my 5 month old pit bull puppy eating rocks? my dog is very active and has a really good appetite. she loves to play and is very well mannered. lately she has been eating small pea gravel from my landscaping. is she just being a puppy or is something wrong?

ANSWER: nothing wrong, but you shouldn't let her eat that. Its not like they are nutrious or anything. DIET!! something is missing!! change food!! maybe you might want to keep your dog inside and see a vet it may be mental or it is starving cause it doesn't like the food.Also in courage it to eat food and not eat rocks It's trying to show you it's intelligence level.

You probably shouldn't let her eat them though. No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots. You still shouldn't let her eat it though. Trust me  we have a 6 month old boxer pup. He takes red hot pieces of coal out of the fire and then barks at them when they burn his mouth. Trust me. Puppies don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. Monst puppies teath until about 6-7 months so she is only doing that because she still has her baby teeth and thats what puppys do, they chew oon things alot. but don't let her she will get sick, very sick, trust me i'd know some dogs are prone to eat things they shouldn't ....don't allow her to eat them....you should be able to control the puppy...if not you will have a problem dog on your hands. She is just being a puppy.  Make sure she doesn't choke on or swallow any of the gravel. 

QUESTION: why is my 5 month old pit bull puppy eating rocks? my dog is very active and has a really good appetite. she loves to play and is very well mannered. lately she has been eating small pea gravel from my landscaping. is she just being a puppy or is something wrong?

ANSWER: nothing wrong, but you shouldn't let her eat that. Its not like they are nutrious or anything. DIET!! something is missing!! change food!! maybe you might want to keep your dog inside and see a vet it may be mental or it is starving cause it doesn't like the food.Also in courage it to eat food and not eat rocks It's trying to show you it's intelligence level. The only thing stupider then dogs are the people who own them! THIS IS NORMAL FOR DOGS TO DO...BUT I WOULD IF I WAS YOU KEEP HER FROM DOINGING THIS BC IF TO MANY IN HER TUMMY SHE WONT BE ABLE TO PASS THEM OUT AND IT COULD RIP HER TUMMY AND BUM.....AND THEN YOUR LOOKING AT ALOT OF MONEY....JAY AKA PITA Well there you go! I would make sure you have lots of stuff for her to chew! Puppies need to gnaw on stuff all the time. I found this out the hard way, when my dog chewed off the handles of my screwdrivers and other things. Try raw hide chews and many other kinds at a pet store near you! naw naw dont worry cuz is. they grow up and their teeth is start to develop up and they feel an comforable when their teeth is in their mouth especially at that ages...and they will chew soem wierd stuff liek my dog i let him choose either is the shovel or hamburger toy he choose the shovel and can chew on it for hour and hour.....they wierd Don't want to scare you but I had a Golden Retriever doing that and ended up with a foot of stones in her intestine.  Went into shock and needed major surgery.  If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work. I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.

DIET!! something is missing!! change food!! maybe you might want to keep your dog inside and see a vet it may be mental or it is starving cause it doesn't like the food.Also in courage it to eat food and not eat rocks It's trying to show you it's intelligence level. The only thing stupider then dogs are the people who own them! THIS IS NORMAL FOR DOGS TO DO...BUT I WOULD IF I WAS YOU KEEP HER FROM DOINGING THIS BC IF TO MANY IN HER TUMMY SHE WONT BE ABLE TO PASS THEM OUT AND IT COULD RIP HER TUMMY AND BUM.....AND THEN YOUR LOOKING AT ALOT OF MONEY....JAY AKA PITA Well there you go! I would make sure you have lots of stuff for her to chew! Puppies need to gnaw on stuff all the time. I found this out the hard way, when my dog chewed off the handles of my screwdrivers and other things. Try raw hide chews and many other kinds at a pet store near you! naw naw dont worry cuz is. they grow up and their teeth is start to develop up and they feel an comforable when their teeth is in their mouth especially at that ages...and they will chew soem wierd stuff liek my dog i let him choose either is the shovel or hamburger toy he choose the shovel and can chew on it for hour and hour.....they wierd Don't want to scare you but I had a Golden Retriever doing that and ended up with a foot of stones in her intestine.  Went into shock and needed major surgery.  If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work. I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.

My own dog used to eat all our slippers and regurgitate them later on. The best thing is to keep your dog away from small items and give them safe chew toys to help them through it. 

Still, it could be something entirely different...calling up your vet might not be such a bad idea. Your dog might be teething. The hardness of the rocks probably feels good on her new teeth. You probably shouldn't let her eat them though. No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots. You still shouldn't let her eat it though. Trust me  we have a 6 month old boxer pup. He takes red hot pieces of coal out of the fire and then barks at them when they burn his mouth. Trust me. Puppies don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. Monst puppies teath until about 6-7 months so she is only doing that because she still has her baby teeth and thats what puppys do, they chew oon things alot. but don't let her she will get sick, very sick, trust me i'd know some dogs are prone to eat things they shouldn't ....don't allow her to eat them....you should be able to control the puppy...if not you will have a problem dog on your hands. She is just being a puppy.  Make sure she doesn't choke on or swallow any of the gravel.

QUESTION: i need to find a person called jay wilson  son of fred  j. wilson  jay is my brother ive never met thanks? im not exactly sure how old he is but i know hes probably between 30 and 40 im guessing  maybe lived in new england area ?

ANSWER: I am him.  Just kidding, this is not the smartest avenue to find that info dude, don't trust the net.  Go through a more reliable source like a phone directory. this is not a lost and found section.  This is genealogy. the reliable source for your question is : intelius.com   try it once.

good luck. If he was adopted, why don't you try checking his files at the adoption agency? Or maybe you can ask around, who lives in New England, or check the phone directory, hoping that he still uses the same last name. But if you have a striking resemblance of him, why not walk around New England? Maybe, you know, just maybe, someone would pop up the question, "Are you my friend's brother?" Anyway, all the best, man! Do you have any older relatives who might know where he lives (or lived)? If you were seperated by foster care or adoption, there may be legal avenues that you can check. I would not start with a phone book, at least not until you have narrowed your search to a smaller area than a whole state.

Good luck on your search!

A man and a woman who have never met before find themselves in the same sleeping carriage of a train. After the initial embarrassment, they both manage to get to sleep; the woman on the top bunk, the man on the lower. 
In the middle of the night the woman leans over and says, "I'm sorry to bother you, but I'm awfully cold and I was wondering if you could possibly pass me another blanket." 
The man leans out and with a glint in his eye said "I've got a better idea ... let's pretend we're married." 
"Why not," giggles the woman. 
"Good," he replies. "Get your own blanket." OMG>>>>>>.those were hilarious>>>>really genius wit>>>LOL

Try raw hide chews and many other kinds at a pet store near you! naw naw dont worry cuz is. they grow up and their teeth is start to develop up and they feel an comforable when their teeth is in their mouth especially at that ages...and they will chew soem wierd stuff liek my dog i let him choose either is the shovel or hamburger toy he choose the shovel and can chew on it for hour and hour.....they wierd Don't want to scare you but I had a Golden Retriever doing that and ended up with a foot of stones in her intestine.  Went into shock and needed major surgery.  If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work. I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.

My own dog used to eat all our slippers and regurgitate them later on. The best thing is to keep your dog away from small items and give them safe chew toys to help them through it. 

Still, it could be something entirely different...calling up your vet might not be such a bad idea. Your dog might be teething. The hardness of the rocks probably feels good on her new teeth. You probably shouldn't let her eat them though. No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots. You still shouldn't let her eat it though. Trust me  we have a 6 month old boxer pup. He takes red hot pieces of coal out of the fire and then barks at them when they burn his mouth. Trust me. Puppies don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. Monst puppies teath until about 6-7 months so she is only doing that because she still has her baby teeth and thats what puppys do, they chew oon things alot. but don't let her she will get sick, very sick, trust me i'd know some dogs are prone to eat things they shouldn't ....don't allow her to eat them....you should be able to control the puppy...if not you will have a problem dog on your hands. She is just being a puppy.  Make sure she doesn't choke on or swallow any of the gravel.
