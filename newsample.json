It does happen in Indian families.  If it happens once, it can be forgiven, but if it becomes a pattern, then it must be stopped.

Aint seen it happen in family but a family friend's :husband used to slap his mrs about....she eventually cut free (clever cow). The husb turned more to alcohol that before, remarried and now slaps the new bird about.  Whats the moral of this story...? Dont know, u asked so there u have it.", 'people fight, and then they can\'t control the anger.\n  I\'m pretty sure it happens in families all over the world. Technically, it\'s not abuse if both parties are involved and they "make-up" later. hahaha, usually in Indian families the woman just yells or fights back.\nThey\'re usually stable like yin-yang lol...it\'s a balance.'], 'title': 'For Indians only?'}
