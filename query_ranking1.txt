QUESTION: for indians only? for ladies or anyone who saw this happen in their family... that a woman was slapped on  face by  husband during an argument?

ANSWER: I fail to see why this question was addressed to Indians only, any man who raises his hand to a woman is a complete jerk, coward and very insecure. This is wrong and will be considered abuse.  It does happen in Indian families.  If it happens once, it can be forgiven, but if it becomes a pattern, then it must be stopped.  Either the husband needs counseling or the wife needs to get out. 

I don't think its acceptable any more. what a dumb question to ask?

     but ya,it happens at times because men think that they are the superior race n can get away scot free with any wrong act done by them.they are basically bloody M.C.P's n serious action should be taken against them. Why is this for Indians only? domestic violence (and that is exactly what this is if repetitive) is a global issue not just an Indian one.  Aint seen it happen in family but a family friend's :husband used to slap his mrs about....she eventually cut free (clever cow). The husb turned more to alcohol that before, remarried and now slaps the new bird about.  Whats the moral of this story...? Dont know, u asked so there u have it. people fight, and then they can't control the anger.
  I'm pretty sure it happens in families all over the world. Technically, it's not abuse if both parties are involved and they "make-up" later. hahaha, usually in Indian families the woman just yells or fights back.
They're usually stable like yin-yang lol...it's a balance.

QUESTION: how do i find someone who i met 10 years ago from hamburg if i only know her first name? (rike)? she was in italy (meta di sorrento) in 1997 and had a shaved head at he time. blue eyes, about 1.68 m 
she should be about 28 now.

ANSWER: Maybe you should try in the travel categories with the country Germany. You never know if someone recognizes it. Too bad you don't know a last time, otherwise the telephone guides would have worked.

Good luck!!
let us know if it worked out! dont waste your time or money on internet searches.

youre gonna have to hire a private detective and probably write a lot of letters to women with that same first name who lived there at that time. thats the only way i can think of. Dunno but sounds like a sweet story. Gd luk, hope you find her!

QUESTION: why is my 5 month old pit bull puppy eating rocks? my dog is very active and has a really good appetite. she loves to play and is very well mannered. lately she has been eating small pea gravel from my landscaping. is she just being a puppy or is something wrong?

ANSWER: nothing wrong, but you shouldn't let her eat that. Its not like they are nutrious or anything. DIET!! something is missing!! change food!! maybe you might want to keep your dog inside and see a vet it may be mental or it is starving cause it doesn't like the food.Also in courage it to eat food and not eat rocks It's trying to show you it's intelligence level. The only thing stupider then dogs are the people who own them! THIS IS NORMAL FOR DOGS TO DO...BUT I WOULD IF I WAS YOU KEEP HER FROM DOINGING THIS BC IF TO MANY IN HER TUMMY SHE WONT BE ABLE TO PASS THEM OUT AND IT COULD RIP HER TUMMY AND BUM.....AND THEN YOUR LOOKING AT ALOT OF MONEY....JAY AKA PITA Well there you go! I would make sure you have lots of stuff for her to chew! Puppies need to gnaw on stuff all the time. I found this out the hard way, when my dog chewed off the handles of my screwdrivers and other things. Try raw hide chews and many other kinds at a pet store near you! naw naw dont worry cuz is. they grow up and their teeth is start to develop up and they feel an comforable when their teeth is in their mouth especially at that ages...and they will chew soem wierd stuff liek my dog i let him choose either is the shovel or hamburger toy he choose the shovel and can chew on it for hour and hour.....they wierd Don't want to scare you but I had a Golden Retriever doing that and ended up with a foot of stones in her intestine.  Went into shock and needed major surgery.  If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work. I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.

My own dog used to eat all our slippers and regurgitate them later on. The best thing is to keep your dog away from small items and give them safe chew toys to help them through it. 

Still, it could be something entirely different...calling up your vet might not be such a bad idea. Your dog might be teething. The hardness of the rocks probably feels good on her new teeth. You probably shouldn't let her eat them though. No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots. You still shouldn't let her eat it though. Trust me  we have a 6 month old boxer pup. He takes red hot pieces of coal out of the fire and then barks at them when they burn his mouth. Trust me. Puppies don't have 2 brain cells to rub together. Monst puppies teath until about 6-7 months so she is only doing that because she still has her baby teeth and thats what puppys do, they chew oon things alot. but don't let her she will get sick, very sick, trust me i'd know some dogs are prone to eat things they shouldn't ....don't allow her to eat them....you should be able to control the puppy...if not you will have a problem dog on your hands. She is just being a puppy.  Make sure she doesn't choke on or swallow any of the gravel.
