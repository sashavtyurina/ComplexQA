QUESTION :: Does Cayenne hurt house plants? Hello everyone,

I just moved in with a new roommate. I am finding out that her cat loves to eat all my house plants. I haven't had this problem with my cat. Looking up info on trying to stop my roommates cat from eating plants and I see a remedy that calls for putting cayenne pepper on the plant to deter in worst case scenarios. I think I have reached this point, because the cat loves to play with the squirts from the squirt gun.  But my question is will the cayenne hurt my plants.

Thanks for any answers,
-Chris

QUESTION :: Those who do not believe in God: mock him to his face.? Considering the stories I read about those who mocked God and died, I thought it would be interesting to dare atheists to do the same. Okay. So, you don't believe in God. I dare all atheists, then, to mock him. In particular, you all should challenge him to stop you from doing something, preferably while insulting him. Say that God can't do it, and see what happens.

QUESTION :: Relationship advice? Okay, here's the thing. This girl broke up with me last year. Now I have a new girlfriend who I love very much. However, I got an email reminder of the first's birthday yesterday, with a note saying, "I do still love her." Apparently, I saved that last year after she broke up with me when I still had feelings for her. Anyway, when I read that, it almost felt like it was TELLING me that I do still love her, even just a little bit. But I love my girlfriend now...but what do I do? (preferably to get my mind off the one who broke up with me)...oh, yeah, she told me she still has feelings for me, too...but I told her I didn't because I didn't at the time, but now I'm not so sure. Advice?

QUESTION :: Does Cayenne hurt house plants? Hello everyone,

I just moved in with a new roommate. I am finding out that her cat loves to eat all my house plants. I haven't had this problem with my cat. Looking up info on trying to stop my roommates cat from eating plants and I see a remedy that calls for putting cayenne pepper on the plant to deter in worst case scenarios. I think I have reached this point, because the cat loves to play with the squirts from the squirt gun.  But my question is will the cayenne hurt my plants.

Thanks for any answers,
-Chris

QUESTION :: Does Cayenne hurt house plants? Hello everyone,

I just moved in with a new roommate. I am finding out that her cat loves to eat all my house plants. I haven't had this problem with my cat. Looking up info on trying to stop my roommates cat from eating plants and I see a remedy that calls for putting cayenne pepper on the plant to deter in worst case scenarios. I think I have reached this point, because the cat loves to play with the squirts from the squirt gun.  But my question is will the cayenne hurt my plants.

Thanks for any answers,
-Chris
