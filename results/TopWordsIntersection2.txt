QUESTION :: Does Cayenne hurt house plants? Hello everyone,

I just moved in with a new roommate. I am finding out that her cat loves to eat all my house plants. I haven't had this problem with my cat. Looking up info on trying to stop my roommates cat from eating plants and I see a remedy that calls for putting cayenne pepper on the plant to deter in worst case scenarios. I think I have reached this point, because the cat loves to play with the squirts from the squirt gun.  But my question is will the cayenne hurt my plants.

Thanks for any answers,

QUESTION :: My new girlfriend has kids... should I tell my friends? My friends or people I hang out with in this case aren't really as important as say my girlfriend or closer friends.

QUESTION :: Both in love beyond words...cant be together...do I let go? We are both in love, more than I thought possible, but he has gone back to his wife and kids for their sake, hes not happy but cant cause more pain.  They do not have a physical relationship.

Do I keep a relationship, constantly reminded of how much I love and miss him when we are not together, having faith that it will work out in the end, or just cut it off completely, end the relationship, and try to move on.  I am not that young and have plenty of life experiences so this is not an infatuation.
