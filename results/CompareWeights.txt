QUESTION :: 1

Why is my 5 month old pit bull puppy eating rocks? My dog is very active and has a really good appetite. She loves to play and is very well mannered. Lately she has been eating small pea gravel from my landscaping. Is she just being a puppy or is something wrong?

ASNWERS :: 
nothing wrong, but you shouldn't let her eat that. Its not like they are nutrious or anything.
########
DIET!! something is missing!! change food!!
########
maybe you might want to keep your dog inside and see a vet it may be mental or it is starving cause it doesn't like the food.Also in courage it to eat food and not eat rocks
########
It's trying to show you it's intelligence level. The only thing stupider then dogs are the people who own them!
########
THIS IS NORMAL FOR DOGS TO DO...BUT I WOULD IF I WAS YOU KEEP HER FROM DOINGING THIS BC IF TO MANY IN HER TUMMY SHE WONT BE ABLE TO PASS THEM OUT AND IT COULD RIP HER TUMMY AND BUM.....AND THEN YOUR LOOKING AT ALOT OF MONEY....JAY AKA PITA
########
Well there you go! I would make sure you have lots of stuff for her to chew! Puppies need to gnaw on stuff all the time. I found this out the hard way, when my dog chewed off the handles of my screwdrivers and other things. Try raw hide chews and many other kinds at a pet store near you!
########
naw naw dont worry cuz is. they grow up and their teeth is start to develop up and they feel an comforable when their teeth is in their mouth especially at that ages...and they will chew soem wierd stuff liek my dog i let him choose either is the shovel or hamburger toy he choose the shovel and can chew on it for hour and hour.....they wierd
########
Don't want to scare you but I had a Golden Retriever doing that and ended up with a foot of stones in her intestine.  Went into shock and needed major surgery.  If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work.
########
I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.

My own dog used to eat all our slippers and regurgitate them later on. The best thing is to keep your dog away from small items and give them safe chew toys to help them through it. 

Still, it could be something entirely different...calling up your vet might not be such a bad idea.
########
Your dog might be teething. The hardness of the rocks probably feels good on her new teeth. You probably shouldn't let her eat them though.
########
No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots. You still shouldn't let her eat it though. Trust me  we have a 6 month old boxer pup. He takes red hot pieces of coal out of the fire and then barks at them when they burn his mouth. Trust me. Puppies don't have 2 brain cells to rub together.
########
Monst puppies teath until about 6-7 months so she is only doing that because she still has her baby teeth and thats what puppys do, they chew oon things alot. but don't let her she will get sick, very sick, trust me i'd know
########
some dogs are prone to eat things they shouldn't ....don't allow her to eat them....you should be able to control the puppy...if not you will have a problem dog on your hands.
########
She is just being a puppy.  Make sure she doesn't choke on or swallow any of the gravel.

QUESTION :: 37

Kidney Failure? My mother is suffering of kidney failure but she is not at the point of dialysis yet but she has too much protein in her urine.  Does anyone know of anything that helps get rid off protein in the urine for someone suffering of kidney failure.  At this stage, food is not an issue that has been confirmed by a specialist. . .

ASNWERS :: 
The protein in the urine is a symptom of the kidney failure.  Kidney failure can be caused by many things. If that cause can be taken care of, then maybe the kidney can recover.  For example, if your mom has a kidney infection, then maybe she can regain kidney function.  I have been a dialysis technician for a year, so I'm not an expert, but I know a little.  

In my time as a dialysis tech, I've seen 2 people regain kidney function.  The people it happened to, regained function after a few months on dialysis.  The longer the problem persists, the more damage is done to the kidneys, the less likely it is that function can return.

It is important to know that if your mom's kidneys cannot regain function, and she is treated with dialysis, her world has not ended.  Dialysis is a very effective life prolonging /sustaining treatment.  If your mom eats healthy, controls her fluid intake, and doesn't skip treatments, she can live a long time.  Depending on age, previous health condition, etc., people can live for another 10-15 years on dialysis.  I know people who have been on it since they were teenagers and now have grandchildren.

The important thing is to take it all one step at a time.  Listen to your doctors and NEVER stop asking questions.  Don't be afraid or embarassed to ask for second opinions. There are lots of resourves out there, like the National Kidney Foundation. The people who don't survive are generally the ones who don't care, who don't want to know anything, who don't want to follow the advice of healthcare professionals.
########
It is necessary to treat the underlying condition that is causing proteinuria. For example, when diabetes or hypertension is present, treatment involves controlling blood pressure with the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitor, like captopril (capotenÂ®). Ace inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a substance that normally causes the veins to constrict. The result is a reduction in blood pressure. 

The goal is to reduce blood pressure below 130 systolic and 80 diastolic. After bun, creatinine, and potassium are monitored for 7 to 10 days, ace inhibitors are gradually increased to avoid side effects. The degree of proteinuria is checked periodically and typically improves with every dose. 

It is necessary to monitor blood sugar, salt intake, diet, and exercise.
########
water helps the kidneys. you will have to check with a doctor. what might work perfect for someone, might kill another.
########
the protein is in the urine because the kidneys arent fitlering correctly, which is the problem youre trying to correct... unfortunately, theres not much you can do outside of a transplant

QUESTION :: 3

For high schoolers how many hours a day is perfect for school? Give me some specifics... how many class periods should they have, how long for lunch, how long the class periods should be. And give me some realistic answers. Don't say 2 hours should be for lunch or something like that.

ASNWERS :: 
Im answering this question from an adult point of view. I work in a high school and there are 8 periods that run about 45 minutes each. There is a 10 minute break in the morning and a 25 minute lunch. Although the break and lunch seem short, they are actually a good amout of time. Any longer than that gives the students time to start fooling around and lose focus. The school day should be well structured and the transition between classes should be about 3 minutes for a smaller school.
########
From my perspective, I believe 6 periods a day. Each period should go for 45-50 minutes. Then there should be one recess break that should last for 20 minutes between 2nd and 3rd period. While lunch should be about 45 minutes between period 4 and 5. = ]

QUESTION :: 5

Does Cayenne hurt house plants? Hello everyone,

I just moved in with a new roommate. I am finding out that her cat loves to eat all my house plants. I haven't had this problem with my cat. Looking up info on trying to stop my roommates cat from eating plants and I see a remedy that calls for putting cayenne pepper on the plant to deter in worst case scenarios. I think I have reached this point, because the cat loves to play with the squirts from the squirt gun.  But my question is will the cayenne hurt my plants.

Thanks for any answers,
-Chris

ASNWERS :: 
Not that I know of.  It might if you put it directly on the leaves though.  Try it on a single leaf.  It's also said that cat's don't like citrus so maybe spray your plants with some diluted orange oil.

Cats like to eat greens.  If I don't give my cat a plant of her own to eat, she eats the others.  Try growing some wheatgrass just for the cat to eat and I bet it will quit eating yours.
########
Red pepper doesn't work for one of my cats. I thought I'd try black pepper if he pesters a plant.

Be nice to your roommate's feline companion and get him a pot of catnip. If he prefers that, he may also leave your plants alone. If not, it's great entertainment.
########
You could always try it on just one leaf to see what happens if you are worried about destroying the whole plant.
########
You could actually plant some pepper plants in with your other plants.

I don't think the pepper will hurt, but im not a plant expert.
########
No it shouldn't hurt your plants. It never hurt mine. The catnip idea is a good one. Place the pot where the cat is most likely to get to it. And place your plants in different spots. he may be too lazy to go after your plants with the catnip so easy to get to. Also, most pets stores and vet offices sell a product called bitter apple spray. It is made from apple skins and is very sour and bitter to animals. If sprayed around the outside of the pot it may deter him after one taste. My neoghbor used it to stop her dogs from chewing up thecouch. One taste worked.

junior prom tickets? for the students, do we have "wedding style" tickets with an envelope, card, photo info, etc? or is that just for the chaperones? i was thinking of a huge "index card" length ticket. i dunno. just give me some input plz.

ASNWERS :: 
I don't think it would really matter. It's your prom and you can be as creative as you want with it. 
I think it would go along with whatever your theme is. If you had a really elegant, formal theme, a more elaborate invite would be appropriate. If it's a jungle theme, or something more fun, it can be more laid back. Just have fun with it. I promise you no one even pays attention to the invites. Go cheap and above all- EASY!

ASNWERS :: 
That's a very hard choice because all three can help you in poms. What do you want to do? Do you want a future as a professional dancer? If so, take ballet. Ballet is the base of all dance and it can only help you. If you're planning on doing poms/dance team in school, take jazz. There are many elements in jazz that are similar to those in poms and jazz also teaches good techniques.

What causes neck spasms? I have been getting spasms in my neck not all the time but occassionally they will happen... what causes the neck to spasm?  I do have tmj in my jaw...could that be why? And please no answers Like "OMG YOUR DYING!" K thanks.

ASNWERS :: 
Probably a Magnesium deficiency.  

Mg is found in fresh vegetables - especially the green leafy ones - and almonds are a particularly good source.  It is excreted more if you are on diuretics, including caffeine, alcohol.  Magnesium supplements are good to get your levels up.
########
There are several reasons I think. I had them twice, shortly after I migrated from Holland to Australia by myself when I was 21. Only with hindsight I realize that this was pretty stressful.  The first time I went to see a DR because of the pain which is very severe. He told me there was nothing he could do and gave me a week off work. I was depressed and went to a bar, had a whiskey. I had another one and started to feel just fine. Then I had a third one, went home and had a sleep. When I woke up the spasm was gone. You beauty!!!!!!!!!! And still a week with no work.

QUESTION :: 39

How can I get rid of gallstones without having surgery? I was just diagnosed with gallstones in my gallblatter I really dont want to have surgery and have been told that there are other ways to get rid of the stones so if anyone knows how im open for suggestions

ASNWERS :: 
Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol.  You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.

Lowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.

However...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  

If you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing!
########
They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though.
########
If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck
########
Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  

I had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  

Eating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP.
########
The best remedy is surgury. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed. The surgery isn't as bad as you think it may be.

Those who do not believe in God: mock him to his face.? Considering the stories I read about those who mocked God and died, I thought it would be interesting to dare atheists to do the same. Okay. So, you don't believe in God. I dare all atheists, then, to mock him. In particular, you all should challenge him to stop you from doing something, preferably while insulting him. Say that God can't do it, and see what happens.

ASNWERS :: 
Why are you trying to sow dissent here?  There are people on here trying to keep it less like a battlefield and more like a place for important questions on faith, and questions like this don't help.
########
why would you mock something you don't believe in?
########
you are acting like a little child ,i dare god to strike you down with a bolt of lightning 

,do you feel any thing yet.

i thought not ,and your god is not a god ,he cloned Adam in his own image ,and Adam was a normal guy .Eva in turn was cloned from Adam and she was also not a goddess.

this space commander has a lot of blood on his hands ,and apart from being an exstraterestial he was foreign to boot.and he is a rookie having been here barely 6000 years ago.

And the story of being welcome in his garden on the condition that you were dead i find very strange .even stranger than so many people buying this,

I tell you what ,if you renounce your eroneuos ways ,and ask forgiveness for betraying Baal and Gaia the only rightfull gods of this planet for billions of years,

and if you bring several bottles of your best wine ,you will be welcome in our Paradise ,right now ,here on earth 

And the good news is that you dont have to die ,the bad news is that you have to do some weeding and planting ,but that is good for the soul.

And as you seem to have his ear, 
better tell your God ,
to watch it  because
we are the Pee Pees 
the people of Pan
we care for our Planet
where ever we can
you beat us ,you robbed us

you rendered us weak
but we will be back
for we are 

the Meek
########
God cannot delete this answer.

Ooo! I can't wait to see what happens!
########
As a Christian, you should know, not to test God
########
God, you bastard, prove yourself by killing me right this moment.  Strike me dead with lightening (or whatever you see fit) and stop me from typing even one more wor... ahhhhg!

Heh, I'm still here.  Would you like me to blaspheme the holy spirit as well? 

God can't do anything to me, because nonexistent imaginary beings are powerless.  

...or maybe he just doesn't read Yahoo! answers?
########
Everybody dies you fool
########
I fart in the general direction of God, Jesus and the ghost one too.  Stop me easting this apple, oh, oh, too late mmmmm.  It actually tastes better when I insult God.
########
Your idea that God would wish to prove his existence shows you aren't much of a christian yourself.  That is why it is called "faith".
########
u will not stop from writing this answer
########
god doesn't choose whether i live or die! he is nothing but a worm to me!
########
Why? Why bother answering this; athiests don't believe in God or a God of any kind. This question is completely futile; asking this question would be directed toward agnostics on the verge of becoming athiests or people who are anti-Christian/Catholic/etc. Someone who says 'my god is better than yours' is the perfect person to ask this question to.
########
thank god for the 2
########
well i dont think God will want to kill every athiest, because He cares about all of His children and dosnt want any of them to go to hell. he would feel pity for them and probably give them a chance to be saved. sounds like you've misunderstood God quite a bit. thats not how he operates at all.
########
I mock god to stop me from posting this question.
Guess I'm more powerful
########
You really shouldn't do this. Christians are supposed to encourage people to believe in Jesus and trust in God. Why would you encourage them to hurry their damnation?

Having said that, what you are doing is so immature that I would not expect God to play along for your amusement. Grow up.
########
ok!
God can't make me throw up! He doesn't exist!


*whistles* I'm waiting lol
########
Why don't you do something productive to your faith such as telling others about his life and his sacrifice instead of doing this whole "my God is bigger than your God!!" thing? This sounds an awful bit like a playground conversation: "I DARE you to kick over my sand castle, Susy!". Get over yourself.
########
I think most people are more in question than denial, but why instigate? Rather leave the subject be.
########
I don't believe in a God..any God but I won't mock your God because its your right to believe it, just don't mock me or try to push your beliefs on me when I don't believe.  If you actually believed in God you wouldn't have asked that question.  Go with Fish
########
what you dont understand is for an athiest to mock god they would have to admit he exists, dont really feel like talking to myself. that just makes me feel stupid. there is a difference in not believing and hating. to insult someone insinuates that you hate them, who am i insulting if i dont believe in him? ponder that for a while, if you have a relative answer, may your so called god strike me down with all his might
########
I wouldn't mock him if I could see his face, or if there was, oh, i don't know, maybe SOME kind of concrete evidence.  But wait, there isn't, now is there?  God's not real, there's my mocking.  If he is real, he won't let this pen i'm holding touch the ground when I drop it.  I just dropped it, and it hit the ground.
########
Careful with God, what makes you believe that God will listen to you!
########
Jesus said if you beleive in me believe also in My Father, dare we call Jesus a lyer as man is??
########
why start?
########
People tend to scoff at god and the writers of the bible. That bothers me! I wish the were alive or real to scoff in their faces.
########
God can't save my son from his disease, histiocytosis. Chemotherapy will.

And if God wants to come down, I will mock him to his face.
########
mocking a person's religion is a bad thing to do and you should be ashamed of yourself while i am an atheist i do have moral and my principles forbid me to mock another person's beliefs

QUESTION :: 45

Relationship advice? Okay, here's the thing. This girl broke up with me last year. Now I have a new girlfriend who I love very much. However, I got an email reminder of the first's birthday yesterday, with a note saying, "I do still love her." Apparently, I saved that last year after she broke up with me when I still had feelings for her. Anyway, when I read that, it almost felt like it was TELLING me that I do still love her, even just a little bit. But I love my girlfriend now...but what do I do? (preferably to get my mind off the one who broke up with me)...oh, yeah, she told me she still has feelings for me, too...but I told her I didn't because I didn't at the time, but now I'm not so sure. Advice?

ASNWERS :: 
Figure out whom you really have feelings for first and then make your choice and let both of them know what you've decided.
########
Maybe your just thinking about the good times. Focus on why your not together to this day. What made your relationship end. Don't be blinded by the good times,its OK to still have feelings. And the one major issue man you still have a girlfriend and you said you love her. Don't just hurt her like that,you've been there and have done that.
########
you seem better off with the girl you have now.  This girl makes you forget about the other one. That is fantastic.  Just forget about the ex.
########
She's an Ex and a part of your past.....leave her there!
########
Since you have ur second girlfriend come in at the time you were not in a proper emotional state, it would be wise of you to give some time for yourself and think seriously about whom you would like to spend the rest of your life with and then make appropriate decisons.
########
First of all, its better for suggestions here and not advice.  

Now, if it was only an email reminder that you left on your computer, then maybe you dont still love her.  You can still have fond feelings and even a bit of love for her, yet you say you love the one you are with.  Then love her and let the past stay in the past.

Its better to move on that to hang on to something that took off a long time ago.  Enjoy the love that you share with the woman you are with now and let the other go completely.  After all, it has been a year right?

Theres no way to get the one woman out of your head completely though.  There will always be those little times that the one/ ones you thought you loved will always pop in your mind.  The only thing one can do really is move on in life.
########
Forget about the first girl. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence you know? If it was meant to be it would have worked out the first time. If you love the girl you're with, be content with that.
########
You're one messed up dude. Search your feelings and decide once and for all. And then do the right thing based on what you decide.

Saying you have feelings for your old GF and she to you is just that - SOME feelings - that you may still love her just a little bit. Is that enough to break up with your current GF? How much do you love your current GF? More or less than your old GF? It is normal to reminisce about old loves and how you used to feel about. Remember, the key word is used to.Good luck to you. I hope you work it out and decide.
########
The grass always seems greener on the other side. But it's really not.
########
Ok, if she broke up with you that's her loss and you need to get over her. If you love this new girl you got then ignore TOG!!! Don't let TOG (the old girl) mess it all up for you!!!!
########
remember she is your ex for a reason! sometimes we long for old relationships but that turns out to be stupid! I went back to an ex and left the most amazing man.. the ex had cheated on me and lied to me! fast forward a year later two months before the wedding i found out he cheated again! I met another man and married him now and four years later am has happy as I can be!!

QUESTION :: 47

why are bassoons so expensive? I was looking at bassoons over at Musician's Friend ( http://www.musiciansfriend.com/bo/navigation?page=1&N=100001+305585&Ns=P_Price%7C0 ) and am wondering why they cost $2500-$14,000.

Does anyone know?
Thanks
m98s

ASNWERS :: 
They are hand made from excellent and expensive wood.  The wood pieces must be structurally perfect in large sizes and are rare.  They take FAR longer to make than any other instrument.

The cheap plastic ones aren't that much more than other instruments.  Also, they are far less popular, so there is a volume/demand issue as well.
########
because they are so beautiful and probably have to be individually made and such.

QUESTION :: 7

How do you know when you are in love? Ok see the love of my life called my house drunk and we are both under age and hes three years older than me but he cussed my dad out and he dont even remember.My dad told me that i am never allowed to talk to him again but he said hell quit drinking and smoking pot just to be with me! I love him with all my heart and i want to be with him for the reat of my life but i talk to him in the mornings an the bus and sometimes at night even though im not supposed to. He said he'll wait for me until I turn 18 but thats a while from now and i dont think my dad will forgive him.I dont know what to do or if he even loves me.Any suggestions?

ASNWERS :: 
Please listen to your dad on this one.  Parents aren't always right, but he is right about this.  First off, if this guy loved you he wouldn't have called your dad and caused this problem in the first place.  I've had enough friends like this boy to know that while you waste your time for the next three years waiting to be with him, he will not be true to you and will just keep you on a string just for fun.  You are just begining to experience life, don't tie yourself down to a drunk who does pot and fights with your dad.  You need to take this time to experience life and be open to all it has to offer you.
########
o i just think that your story's soo sweet..
i advice u to stick with him...hopefully he'll change his ways like he promised u...
and your dad will just hav to understand that it's YOUR CHOICE that u want to  b with him.not trying to disrespect his authority,but to me,if it's love,then it's definitely worth it...good luck:)))
########
Please take what I'm saying to heart. When someone is involed with drugs and alcohol it makes things worse. If he is really into this stuff he will never ever pick you over the drugs he will go back to them time and time again. Your parents can see this being older than you and the fact that he disrespected your father and doesnt even remember is troubling to me. I spent a long time with someone like this and it only turned out bad. Your younge and you have so much life to live still, try living it and having fun with your girlfriends. Forget about this jerk, or see if he can really change. Things will come together once your older. You don't want to waste the best years of you life crying over some drug infested jerk.
