QUESTION :: Does Cayenne hurt house plants? Hello everyone,

I just moved in with a new roommate. I am finding out that her cat loves to eat all my house plants. I haven't had this problem with my cat. Looking up info on trying to stop my roommates cat from eating plants and I see a remedy that calls for putting cayenne pepper on the plant to deter in worst case scenarios. I think I have reached this point, because the cat loves to play with the squirts from the squirt gun.  But my question is will the cayenne hurt my plants.

Thanks for any answers,
-Chris

QUESTION :: Scared to death..? I took my daughter to the emergency room because of a limp. We sat 3 hours, had numerous x-rays done and then lots of blood work and the nurses came in and told me that she needed to see a hematologist on monday and that it wasn't her leg that was bothering her it was her blood. They said they "weren't comfortable" giving a diagnosis but when i said  that she didn't act sick or anything they said "Well she feels pretty bad, I can guarantee that- probably too sick to complain." I'm nervous and scared and don't know what it could be. Her white count was elevated and her iron was 22/3 when it should be 12/17. It's a long weekend and they want me to wait until Monday to know anything..has anyone heard of this before? Experienced it? Any doctors out there that know what it might be?

QUESTION :: Both in love beyond words...cant be together...do I let go? We are both in love, more than I thought possible, but he has gone back to his wife and kids for their sake, hes not happy but cant cause more pain.  They do not have a physical relationship.  We still see each other and there are no promises made, but I truly doubt in my heart he will stay married after the kids are out of the house in 5 years or so.  Do I keep a relationship, constantly reminded of how much I love and miss him when we are not together, having faith that it will work out in the end, or just cut it off completely, end the relationship, and try to move on.  I am not that young and have plenty of life experiences so this is not an infatuation.

QUESTION :: Does Cayenne hurt house plants? Hello everyone,

I just moved in with a new roommate. I am finding out that her cat loves to eat all my house plants. I haven't had this problem with my cat. Looking up info on trying to stop my roommates cat from eating plants and I see a remedy that calls for putting cayenne pepper on the plant to deter in worst case scenarios. I think I have reached this point, because the cat loves to play with the squirts from the squirt gun.  But my question is will the cayenne hurt my plants.

Thanks for any answers,
-Chris

QUESTION :: Okay, i need actual help here? Okay, so last night the american music awards were on and i was SO psyced that i just had to watch it so decided to record Veronica Mars and watch it later. The problem was that my VCR had been on the wrong channel and i got a black screen for the entire hour. This eppie was supposed to be So good and i really need to see it.

So, i've been looking online for the past hour for sites that have the eppisode online and can't find any. So can someone ACTUALLY look and not just give me something that would have vids on it like youtube, because i looked there and it wasn't on there. Also tried to cw site and everywhere else.

If someone can actually find the site with the video on it, i'll give you 10pts. <33

QUESTION :: Scared to death..? I took my daughter to the emergency room because of a limp. We sat 3 hours, had numerous x-rays done and then lots of blood work and the nurses came in and told me that she needed to see a hematologist on monday and that it wasn't her leg that was bothering her it was her blood. They said they "weren't comfortable" giving a diagnosis but when i said  that she didn't act sick or anything they said "Well she feels pretty bad, I can guarantee that- probably too sick to complain." I'm nervous and scared and don't know what it could be. Her white count was elevated and her iron was 22/3 when it should be 12/17. It's a long weekend and they want me to wait until Monday to know anything..has anyone heard of this before? Experienced it? Any doctors out there that know what it might be?

QUESTION :: Both in love beyond words...cant be together...do I let go? We are both in love, more than I thought possible, but he has gone back to his wife and kids for their sake, hes not happy but cant cause more pain.  They do not have a physical relationship.  We still see each other and there are no promises made, but I truly doubt in my heart he will stay married after the kids are out of the house in 5 years or so.  Do I keep a relationship, constantly reminded of how much I love and miss him when we are not together, having faith that it will work out in the end, or just cut it off completely, end the relationship, and try to move on.  I am not that young and have plenty of life experiences so this is not an infatuation.
