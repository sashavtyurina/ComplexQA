ANSWERS: 
nothing wrong, but you shouldn't let her eat that. Its not like they are nutrious or anything.
***
DIET!! something is missing!! change food!!
***
maybe you might want to keep your dog inside and see a vet it may be mental or it is starving cause it doesn't like the food.Also in courage it to eat food and not eat rocks
***
It's trying to show you it's intelligence level. The only thing stupider then dogs are the people who own them!
***
THIS IS NORMAL FOR DOGS TO DO...BUT I WOULD IF I WAS YOU KEEP HER FROM DOINGING THIS BC IF TO MANY IN HER TUMMY SHE WONT BE ABLE TO PASS THEM OUT AND IT COULD RIP HER TUMMY AND BUM.....AND THEN YOUR LOOKING AT ALOT OF MONEY....JAY AKA PITA
***
Well there you go! I would make sure you have lots of stuff for her to chew! Puppies need to gnaw on stuff all the time. I found this out the hard way, when my dog chewed off the handles of my screwdrivers and other things. Try raw hide chews and many other kinds at a pet store near you!
***
naw naw dont worry cuz is. they grow up and their teeth is start to develop up and they feel an comforable when their teeth is in their mouth especially at that ages...and they will chew soem wierd stuff liek my dog i let him choose either is the shovel or hamburger toy he choose the shovel and can chew on it for hour and hour.....they wierd
***
Don't want to scare you but I had a Golden Retriever doing that and ended up with a foot of stones in her intestine.  Went into shock and needed major surgery.  If it is a constant problem, surgery would be required quite often, something I couldn't afford and had to relinquish her to the vet where she was adopted and put in a controlled environment.  We go camping and couldn't control her surroundings.  I would try putting something like Tobasco or Bitter Apple on the gravel to see if your pup stops picking up the stones.  I tried to get mine to give them to me but she just swallowed them faster.  You might also set off a mouse trap in front of her, if she acts afraid, then see if placing a few around your home keeps her away from the gravel.  DO NOT TEASE with trap or any other object used to train a pup, it totally defeats the purpose, I only mention this because I know of people who do, think its funny but wonder why tricks to break a habit don't work.
***
I'd say she's just being a puppy. There's a period during a dog's life, much like a human's, called teething. They just chew and eat everything in sight.

My own dog used to eat all our slippers and regurgitate them later on. The best thing is to keep your dog away from small items and give them safe chew toys to help them through it. 

Still, it could be something entirely different...calling up your vet might not be such a bad idea.
***
Your dog might be teething. The hardness of the rocks probably feels good on her new teeth. You probably shouldn't let her eat them though.
***
No she's just being a puppy. All puppies are idiots. You still shouldn't let her eat it though. Trust me  we have a 6 month old boxer pup. He takes red hot pieces of coal out of the fire and then barks at them when they burn his mouth. Trust me. Puppies don't have 2 brain cells to rub together.
***
Monst puppies teath until about 6-7 months so she is only doing that because she still has her baby teeth and thats what puppys do, they chew oon things alot. but don't let her she will get sick, very sick, trust me i'd know
***
some dogs are prone to eat things they shouldn't ....don't allow her to eat them....you should be able to control the puppy...if not you will have a problem dog on your hands.
***
She is just being a puppy.  Make sure she doesn't choke on or swallow any of the gravel.

QUESTION: microsoft points for 360? i got bored, so i was looking around on my xbox 360 dashboard, when i came to the whole page that told you completely about microsoft points. it said you can buy them, and that you can also get them from promotions and stuff.

what kind of promotions do they mean?

and is there a way to get them for free?
ANSWERS: 
With Microsoft pts, you can download Xbox Live Arcade games (lots of classic arcade games in here), extras and add-ons for games you already own (like extra quests for Oblivion or car bundles for NFS: Carbon)...I don't know of a way to get them for free, but they are not that expensive and can be purchased directly from Xbox Live or in a gift-card-type form from GameStop (or whatever your local equivalent is) that provides you a code to enter on Xbox Live and then transfers those points to your account.

Hope all that helps, good luck!

~Scottie
***
You can get them for free from the promotions.

I don't think anyone has ever gotten free MS points from promotions.

But if there should be MS points for a promotion, it might be through the 20 oz soda caps or from buying MS products, like the new Zune players.

QUESTION: for high schoolers how many hours a day is perfect for school? give me some specifics... how many class periods should they have, how long for lunch, how long the class periods should be. and give me some realistic answers. don't say 2 hours should be for lunch or something like that.
ANSWERS: 
Im answering this question from an adult point of view. I work in a high school and there are 8 periods that run about 45 minutes each. There is a 10 minute break in the morning and a 25 minute lunch. Although the break and lunch seem short, they are actually a good amout of time. Any longer than that gives the students time to start fooling around and lose focus. The school day should be well structured and the transition between classes should be about 3 minutes for a smaller school.
***
From my perspective, I believe 6 periods a day. Each period should go for 45-50 minutes. Then there should be one recess break that should last for 20 minutes between 2nd and 3rd period. While lunch should be about 45 minutes between period 4 and 5. = ]

QUESTION: does cayenne hurt house plants? hello everyone,

i just moved in with a new roommate. i am finding out that her cat loves to eat all my house plants. i haven't had this problem with my cat. looking up info on trying to stop my roommates cat from eating plants and i see a remedy that calls for putting cayenne pepper on the plant to deter in worst case scenarios. i think i have reached this point, because the cat loves to play with the squirts from the squirt gun.  but my question is will the cayenne hurt my plants.

thanks for any answers,
-chris
ANSWERS: 
Not that I know of.  It might if you put it directly on the leaves though.  Try it on a single leaf.  It's also said that cat's don't like citrus so maybe spray your plants with some diluted orange oil.

Cats like to eat greens.  If I don't give my cat a plant of her own to eat, she eats the others.  Try growing some wheatgrass just for the cat to eat and I bet it will quit eating yours.
***
Red pepper doesn't work for one of my cats. I thought I'd try black pepper if he pesters a plant.

Be nice to your roommate's feline companion and get him a pot of catnip. If he prefers that, he may also leave your plants alone. If not, it's great entertainment.
***
You could always try it on just one leaf to see what happens if you are worried about destroying the whole plant.
***
You could actually plant some pepper plants in with your other plants.

I don't think the pepper will hurt, but im not a plant expert.
***
No it shouldn't hurt your plants. It never hurt mine. The catnip idea is a good one. Place the pot where the cat is most likely to get to it. And place your plants in different spots. he may be too lazy to go after your plants with the catnip so easy to get to. Also, most pets stores and vet offices sell a product called bitter apple spray. It is made from apple skins and is very sour and bitter to animals. If sprayed around the outside of the pot it may deter him after one taste. My neoghbor used it to stop her dogs from chewing up thecouch. One taste worked.

QUESTION: how do you know when you are in love? ok see the love of my life called my house drunk and we are both under age and hes three years older than me but he cussed my dad out and he dont even remember.my dad told me that i am never allowed to talk to him again but he said hell quit drinking and smoking pot just to be with me! i love him with all my heart and i want to be with him for the reat of my life but i talk to him in the mornings an the bus and sometimes at night even though im not supposed to. he said he'll wait for me until i turn 18 but thats a while from now and i dont think my dad will forgive him.i dont know what to do or if he even loves me.any suggestions?
ANSWERS: 
Please listen to your dad on this one.  Parents aren't always right, but he is right about this.  First off, if this guy loved you he wouldn't have called your dad and caused this problem in the first place.  I've had enough friends like this boy to know that while you waste your time for the next three years waiting to be with him, he will not be true to you and will just keep you on a string just for fun.  You are just begining to experience life, don't tie yourself down to a drunk who does pot and fights with your dad.  You need to take this time to experience life and be open to all it has to offer you.
***
o i just think that your story's soo sweet..
i advice u to stick with him...hopefully he'll change his ways like he promised u...
and your dad will just hav to understand that it's YOUR CHOICE that u want to  b with him.not trying to disrespect his authority,but to me,if it's love,then it's definitely worth it...good luck:)))
***
Please take what I'm saying to heart. When someone is involed with drugs and alcohol it makes things worse. If he is really into this stuff he will never ever pick you over the drugs he will go back to them time and time again. Your parents can see this being older than you and the fact that he disrespected your father and doesnt even remember is troubling to me. I spent a long time with someone like this and it only turned out bad. Your younge and you have so much life to live still, try living it and having fun with your girlfriends. Forget about this jerk, or see if he can really change. Things will come together once your older. You don't want to waste the best years of you life crying over some drug infested jerk.

QUESTION: how many inches should i set my html code at to create a website optimized for 800x600 viewing? alright, so i want to create a webpage that will be viewable on 800x600.  for this i want to know how many inches would be optimal for say a table that i wish to span across the whole screen.
ANSWERS: 
Tough question :)

Best ideea (on my humble oppinion) is to avoid both horizontal and vertical scrolling. For horizontal is simple. Set the layout to a max of 770 pixels.
If you don't want vertical scrolling... it depends on viewer browser, how many extra toolbars he has, etc.
Typically for 800x600 resolution a 430 pixel heigth will do the trick.

As 800x600 is (still) used only by approx 30% of users you should think how your layout will look also at higher resolutions.
At 1024x768 it will still look ok. Higher than this it will be like a column in the middle of the page or on the left side, deppending on your choice of content positioning.

Try a self-adjusting approach. Use as much as possible CSS, avoid tables, keep content centered (both horizontal and vertical).

Some nice browser statistics here:
http://roselli.org/adrian/articles/browser_stats_2.asp

CSS layouts here:
http://blog.html.it/layoutgala/

Good luck and let me know when your site is online!
***
set your width to 800 pixels...don't worry about the inches stuff.
width="800" is all you need to do
***
You should set it to be 779.  The size should take in account a browsers scrollbar, that way you will not have a horizontal scrollbar going across the bottom.

If you have borders on the left and right side then do 777 or less.

You could also do 100%

QUESTION: junior prom tickets? for the students, do we have "wedding style" tickets with an envelope, card, photo info, etc? or is that just for the chaperones? i was thinking of a huge "index card" length ticket. i dunno. just give me some input plz.
ANSWERS: 
I don't think it would really matter. It's your prom and you can be as creative as you want with it. 
I think it would go along with whatever your theme is. If you had a really elegant, formal theme, a more elaborate invite would be appropriate. If it's a jungle theme, or something more fun, it can be more laid back. Just have fun with it. I promise you no one even pays attention to the invites. Go cheap and above all- EASY!

That's a very hard choice because all three can help you in poms. What do you want to do? Do you want a future as a professional dancer? If so, take ballet. Ballet is the base of all dance and it can only help you. If you're planning on doing poms/dance team in school, take jazz. There are many elements in jazz that are similar to those in poms and jazz also teaches good techniques.

QUESTION: serial killers? well i just got finished watching this thing about serial killers, and i was wondering what are the symphtoms of peple who are going to become serial killers when they grow up???????
ANSWERS: 
The professionals refer to it as "the triad" ...

1) Bed wetting (beyond a reasonable age)
2) Torturing animals
3) Starting fires

Obviously, kids that do this don't necessarily grow up to be serial killers, but those are the big warning signs.
***
Many would-be serial killers display sadomasochistic tendencies. They like to torture and kill animals, will be aggressive with peers, they may light fires, get involved in anti-social behaviors, and the like. It is not a misconception when people say "It's always the quiet ones" because some of them also will withdraw from society.
***
Many cases it is from very severe child abuse.In all forms and generally from a combination of sex, mental, physical, emotional, verbal and spiritual. They are so fragmented they are many people in one body due to the abuse.
***
we're just as normal as you......
***
Being in an environment with violent people.

sociopaths.....sometimes as kids they kill or hurt animals and think its ok or worse, funny.  sometimes they are the social outcasts of a group of kids (young kids).....it's hard to tell.....pure evil is always disguised by looking good.
***
Profile of a serial killer  has been involved with cruelty to animals, was abused by a family member, bed wetting, and there are many other symptoms. I recently watched a documentary where they were scanning the brains of people who were convicted of killing only one person and then scanning a subject who has been convicted of multiple killings and a normal person. The brain function in the person  that was convicted of multiple killings were different. Also they were doing a series of test. One where subjects were put in a quite room and watching a t.v. screen where you  would watch a  count down from 10. They were given headphones. When the countdown was over they would hear a noise kinda like nails across a chalkboard. Normal subjects, as they were counting down would sweat, heart rate would increase. Most serial killers, psychopatchs did not have that emotion.

QUESTION: scandalous!i just finished reading playboy magazine,is it possible? i cannot believe that females don't have penis.i always thought that they had a penis and a pair of marbles but they don't even have those.aren't they suppose to have one too,it seem like some of them act like that they actually have one and i'm not talking about lesbians.
ANSWERS: 
Wow. Was that the first naked lady you've ever seen?

Well, if you are familiar with the clitoris, you would notice it resembles a penis (sorta) anyway, when a fetus is developing, the reproductive organs are the same until the fetus reaches a certain stage. At that point, the genitals change and the "penis" either gets bigger in a boy OR it stays the same size and becomes a clitoris in girls. as for the "marbles" they are tucked away neatly in our uterus.

QUESTION: scared to death..? i took my daughter to the emergency room because of a limp. we sat 3 hours, had numerous x-rays done and then lots of blood work and the nurses came in and told me that she needed to see a hematologist on monday and that it wasn't her leg that was bothering her it was her blood. they said they "weren't comfortable" giving a diagnosis but when i said  that she didn't act sick or anything they said "well she feels pretty bad, i can guarantee that- probably too sick to complain." i'm nervous and scared and don't know what it could be. her white count was elevated and her iron was 22/3 when it should be 12/17. it's a long weekend and they want me to wait until monday to know anything..has anyone heard of this before? experienced it? any doctors out there that know what it might be?
ANSWERS: 
I'm not a doctor, nor do I know what it might be. Unfortunately, as parents, we tend to worry and fear the worst when our kids get sick. I know I do. If they were willing to let you wait until Monday to find out what the results are, then I would take it as a sign that it must not be too bad. Otherwise they would have admitted her to the hospital right away. I hope this helps. I'll keep you and your sweet little girl in my prayers.

how high is the white blood count exactly?  A little high could just mean an infection.  If it's completely ridiculously high, that could mean something serious.  I tried to look this up but could not find anything with the combination of lab tests you gave.  Hope everything turns out ok....

If she was anemic, her iron would NOT be high.... it would be low..I am confused as to the 22/3..which one is the iron?

If it were me, I would DEMAND a hematologist see her now... or leave and go to a better emergency room.
***
I wish I could help. Maybe try to get another opinion on Thur or Friday at an urgent care or something? Try not to worry, God bless you.
***
oh that is sad but i am Sherie she will be ok 


(if not sorry )
***
OMG, I'm so sorry to hear this. No I have no idea what's up so I'm not any help. I just wanted to tell you, I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for you and your daughter.
***
She's anemic from something, it could be from bleeding internally it could be something like leukemia, simple or serious but they can't give a diagnosis, she needs a specialist, she's pretty young and sometimes doctors want a specialists opinion rather then guess when they don't know all the facts.  I would try not to worry, let the doctors do the research, learn all you can about what's wrong from them, not from the internet because there are so many things it could be again serious to simple.
***
GOOD LUCK!!!!! HOPE SHE GETS BETTER.
***
I really hate when they do that--waiting really sucks!

I hope U get a Doctor to respond but in the mean time before U worry Urself sick check around the internet about blood disorders.Regardless of what U find do NOT jump to conclusions,find things to do to stay busy until Monday-My thoughts and prayers are with U all.

QUESTION: what causes neck spasms? i have been getting spasms in my neck not all the time but occassionally they will happen... what causes the neck to spasm?  i do have tmj in my jaw...could that be why? and please no answers like "omg your dying!" k thanks.
ANSWERS: 
Probably a Magnesium deficiency.  

Mg is found in fresh vegetables - especially the green leafy ones - and almonds are a particularly good source.  It is excreted more if you are on diuretics, including caffeine, alcohol.  Magnesium supplements are good to get your levels up.
***
There are several reasons I think. I had them twice, shortly after I migrated from Holland to Australia by myself when I was 21. Only with hindsight I realize that this was pretty stressful.  The first time I went to see a DR because of the pain which is very severe. He told me there was nothing he could do and gave me a week off work. I was depressed and went to a bar, had a whiskey. I had another one and started to feel just fine. Then I had a third one, went home and had a sleep. When I woke up the spasm was gone. You beauty!!!!!!!!!! And still a week with no work.

QUESTION: what is this number? here are the clues:
it is an even 3 digit number
it is divisible by 3,4,6,8, and 9.
the sum of it's digits are 18
the difference between the first and second digit equals the third digit.

  it's a real hard problem.
ANSWERS: 
3 digit #'s divisible by 9 & 8 Are multiples of 72. Those whose digits add to 18 are:
288, 576, 648, 792, 864, 936
difference between 1st & 2nd digits =3rd:

792 : 9-7=2   7+9+2=18 792=8*9*11

936  : 9-3=6   9+3+6=18    936=8*9*13

there are 2 solutions: 792 & 936
***
2 (even) = 2
3 = 3
4 = 2 * 2
6 = 2 * 3
8 = 2 * 2 * 2
9 = 3 * 3

The lowest common multiple of all these numbers is 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 72.

So at a minimum the number has to be divisible by 72

The multiples of 72 that are 3 digits long are:
144 - sum is 9
216 - sum is 9
288 - sum is 18, but the difference isn't correct (-6)
360 - sum is 9
432 - sum is 9
504 - sum is 9
576 - sum is 18, but the difference isn't correct (-2)
648 - sum is 18, but the difference isn't correct (2)
720 - sum is 9
792 - sum is 18, but the difference isn't correct* (-2)
864 - sum is 18, but the difference isn't correct (2)
936 - sum is 18, and the difference *is* correct (6) <---

So your answer is 936

Notice also that a - b = c which also means that a = b + c.
Since a + b + c = 18 and b + c = 9, then a must be 9.  This confirms the answer of 936.

* Note: I interpret the difference to mean 1st digit - 2nd digit = 3rd digit, not 2nd digit - 1st digit = 3rd digit.
***
972
***
936
***
abc ids the number

a-b=c
a+b+c=18
from these two it follows that 2a=18 thus a = 9.


divisible by 4 : c is one of 0,2,4,6,8 ( then they are also divisible by 6 )

so the possible numbers are
990 
972
954
936
918

oinly 936 is ok the other are not divisble by 8
***
It is not a hard problem.The number is 792.If however you are strict that the first digit should be greater than the second one,it is 936
***
936

936 is divisible by 3,4,6,8 and 9
9 minus 3 equals 6
9 + 3 + 6 = 18

i got it right, right?

QUESTION: how to make jeans fit you better, how long do you sit in the bath with them on? i've heard that to make jeans fit you better, you should sit in the bath with them on before you first wash them. is this right?  how long for?
ANSWERS: 
Have them tailored.  Jeans from the rack will not fit you perfectly.  I've never heard of the bathtub thing, but even if it did work, the results would be destroyed when you washed them.
***
nope

but them large enough so that they fit

I have about 50 pair, I sort them by actual size and wear the ones that fit

an alternative is to get overalls, they always fit
***
Never heard of this before,lol
***
ive never heard of that b4! there are loads of different syles of jeans from fitted to bootcut. if you prefer them looser but not to baggy try 'boyfriend' jeans. loads of places sell them topshop do a good pair as do new look
***
i never heard of that before
***
Agree with you Ridgely, in my day 1960"s sit in the bath for as long as possible and let them dry on you
Cold water I think?
***
Hmm I've heard of this, but you have to go to a professional place and they custom make and shrink the jeans to fit you perfectly. I think it's a little more complicated than sitting in a bathtub however, so i wouldn't try it. xD
***
They used to do that in the 70's to get super skin tight jeans, it only works with origional pure cotton ones, most modern jeans have a lycra mix for stretchiness and that wont work, you'll just end up with wet jeans. 
If you find some cotton only jeans make sure they are reasonably tight and get em wet then dry them on, they will shrink fit to your body shape. Be warned you wont be able to walk properly or sit down in them though honey! 
Best advice is to get some super tight modern jeans with lycra so you can still breathe in them. Try Miss Sixty, or earl jeans. xxxxxxxxxxxx
***
can only do this if they have not been prehsrunk you will find now days that almost all jeans are. We use to fill the bath up with hot water and sit until you felt them getting tight then get out and drip dry in the yard oh and don;t for get to wipe up the spills
***
OMG...now I've never heard of that one!  But, why don't you just try different styles of jeans until you find one that fits you better?  The jeans that fit your best friend great may not fit you the same way...no matter what you do to them, so get what works for you!
***
6 hours every day
***
OMG...ii have never heard of that
***
NO, that is stupid unless you are going to let them dry on you. You have to buy them fitted to you. You may have a small amt. of shrinksge when you dry them on hig heat but buying them to fit and not skin tight solves that problem. If you are shorter and low wasted buy low or mid rise jeans and try them on. I can't wear reg. jeans because the waist is too high. Mid rise fit much better and show nothing on me. I have to wear a belt sometimes if they are looser at the top. So, buy to fit and wash and dry on low heat if you are afraid of shrinkage at least the first time. Most jeans give a little so that shouldn't matter. Good luck. Also, all brands fit different and all sizes are not the same.
***
You should buy them in the proper size from the get go!!
***
I have never heard that before. I usually buy them a little big to allow for shrinkage, if still big then wear a belt.
***
dont be so daft!
***
That is really oddballing it.
***
ewww. thats awkward.in the bath?
ummm i wouldnt.
if there too tight wash them but hang them up to dry instead of using the dryer.
***
HA HA HA ! we used to wear them wet untill they dried back in the day...
***
I find to make my jeans fit better, I just need to buy the correct size.
***
3 days..
***
uh, no you dont.
***
when new
if you have  us wranglers, or Levis, the best way is  to go in the sea for 20 Min's and lay on the Beach in the sun till dry. we do that  , I like  to see my girlfriend  wiggle out of them.  cheap jeans will fall a part

ANSWERS: 
Try going to Queer-Mart,,, I think they'll have all the gay styles there.
***
Try preppy pants r us or ask for the dickies brand at walmart
***
American Eagle makes great jeans, they fit nice and are pretty cheap. I have a pair of jeans from there I got off the clearance rack for $15! Kohl's also has some great jeans and they have tons of brands and styles. If you really like how Hollister or Abercrombie jeans fit, go to Plato's Closet, they have jeans from both those stores and many others for about $10.
***
Almost all jeans/pants are basically the same fit now a day. because things that aren't in don't sell very well, obviously.
old navy, department stores, stores like gabriel brothers or marshals all carry pants.
or outlet stores. you can get abercrombie/hollister/whatever for super cheap.

he doesn't sound like a best boyfriend. Dump him before he hurts you even more and move on! You'll find someone who'll treat you like Gold!
***
babygirl dont put yourself through that shit leave hes puck ass alone...real shit

Do you purposely spell that poorly?  I thought I was lost without spell check.

Anyway, separate yourself from him.  You should avoid relationships that are hurtful to you.

YOU SHOULD LEARN HOW TO SPELL. GET NEW Boyfriend

dont just jump over decision
make sure that what u think is right
if ur b/f is really treating unfairly
 
dont tolelrate him n try to find out the reason why he behaving like that
***
i'm sorry about how your boyfriend is treating you. but he keeps on doing that because you allow him to.  get out of that relationship at once! believe me, it would get worse! he is simply telling you he doesn't want you anymore, so what are you waiting for? love yourself.  this relationship has not and will not in any way diminish your chances of finding happiness elsewhere. your value as a person does not depend on any man's assessment of you.

QUESTION: my new girlfriend has kids... should i tell my friends? my friends or people i hang out with in this case aren't really as important as say my girlfriend or closer friends. just more of a group of couples and stags that get together from time to time. they are high class and judgmental. their opinions of me mean little but they do enjoy gossip and i'd rather not give them some fuel. should i not let it known my new girl has children and if not, do you think its rude to ask my girlfriend not to mention it?
ANSWERS: 
You're obviously not comfortable telling them that matter although you know that there's nothing wrong with somebody having kids.  You don't want to be the receiving end of their gossip so don't tell them, after all, it's your life and you do what you want to do without exposing yourself to negative stories of certain people.  If you explain this to your girlfriend quite nicely, she will understand that you're not having an issue with her and I think she will understand you.  Good luck.
***
Who cares if she has kids? If you like her and enjoy her company then it shouldn't matter. And it sounds like you should start finding some new "friends." If someone is going to judge you by who you hang out with, or whether or not your girlfriend has kids by someone else, then they certainly aren't friend material.
***
It's not your story to tell.

Add to that, why should you even care what your friends think about it? Go for what makes you happy.  If you keep minding what other people will say, you won't go anywhere.
***
The fact that you even had to pose this question says that you should dump these so-called friends of yours.  If knowing that you are involoved with a woman who has a few kiddies gets their attention that much, then they may need to find other things to do with their lives.  Take up a hobby!  Start a bowling league!  They just need to get a life!(And yes, it would be rude for you to tell your girl not to mention her kids.   No one--well other than really bad parents--like to hide their kids!)
***
What should it matter if she has kids? She's had a prior relationship; so what? Her children shouldn't matter. If anything, that should give her MORE respect. It means she already has experience as a mother
***
If you really like her, they'll find out eventually, and if they are true friends, it won't matter. Let that be the test for you
***
Why wouldn't you tell your friends she has kids? Honey, let me tell you, your "friends" whether they be "high class" or not should not have anything negative to say about your girlfriend having kids. I have a daughter myself and I don't have a problem with getting a date but if the man is not okay with my having my child, he's not for me; not to mention, I would not hide the fact that I have her to please him or his "high class" friends. If they have negative things to say about her having a child/children, "high class" is not the term to use for them. You can't get any more low class. Use your best judgement and talk to your girlfriend about the situation. Just approach that conversation cautiously and explain to her the reasons you feel you should not mention her children, but be delicate and calm toned--that won't be the easiet subject to hit on, but if you want this relationship to go anywhere, she needs to know where you're coming from.
***
if you really love her the best thing to do is say ," my girlfriend has kids, and i dont mind, and if say i am stupid, then ill just have to say yes, stupid in love"
***
Priorities seem to be an issue here and you appear to be a bit confused. Yes it would be rude to ask your girlfriend to hide the fact that she has children. Her children are part of HER and if you want to be with her, you must accept her children as well . If she's a good mother, she will resent your request and it will ruin your relationship. You probably should find a girlfriend with no children, then you wouldn't have to lie.
***
TRUST ME, YOUR MORE OF A MAN THAN THE KIDS DADDY AND YOUR FRIENDS WILL RESPECT YOU FOR WHAT YOUR DOIN, FAIR PLAY TO YOU ..
***
I would just warn her about your friends' tendencies to like to gossip and let her decide.  I have family that is the same way, so I totally understand.  About the opinions not mattering and all.  Its not that it matters, but its so much easier not to have to listen to their gossip, etc. etc.

I would just let her know that there is the potential for them to cause a bit of trouble, and that if she would rather not put up with it, she may want to be selective about the personal information she discloses.  Kids and all.

However, I am pretty sure her response will be the same as mine, which is, Why the Heck are you Hanging Out With Them Then?  -Just warning you...  :-)
***
Maybe in this case you have to choose, your girlfriend or friends, cause their gossiping can hurt her. 

Or, you better tell them in advance that you care for this specific girl and that they should not be rude to her about her kids. If you don't expect them to behave how they should, you should just avoid them

And YES, it is veeeeery rude to ask her not to mention her kids
***
If the two of you are happy then the opinions of others should not matter.  If the topic comes up then be honest but if not then just leave it be, they are going to say whatever they want regardless.  If they are so judgemental with you are they really worth your time to begin with?
***
you should not tell those people you hang out with if you don't want to. Those who are close to you may seem more if i should say helpful because they've got your back if they are up to it. 

No, it is not rude to POLITELY ask your girlfriend not to mention the kids because if you want to prevent something from happening then you need to step up quit being so afraid and tell her but very nicely because you don't want anything to happen in your relationship!


      If you need anything else just email me at: Babylia17@yahoo.com   hope this helps!!!!!*
***
really up to you on that one.  Personally it should not matter.  If your friends are true friends it would not make any difference.  Its how you feel about her having children already.  If its ok with you then you should not need thier approval.
***
you should tell anyone. Dont be ashamed.
***
If your embarrassed by her, then you don't respect her enough to be in the relationship.  Who cares what other people think of her?  I know you want her to be accepted, but hiding things about her is not the way to go about it.  If you are proud of her, show it, then people won't have anything to say.  And yes, its rude to ask her not to say anything....think about your true feelings here, be fair to her.
***
If these aren't your close friends, its not their business, but even if they are it shouldn't be that important to them. Its all about how you feel about her having kids. If she is your girlfriend, you obviously see something in her. When you date a single mom, you also have to have some kind of relationship with the kids, if its serious. I wouldn't care what those people thought.
***
Very bad if you would ask your girlsfriend not to mention her children to your friend.  By the way your friends are not important as your partner they are just the for the entertainment not in sorrows, If I were you I would introduce my girl to them and her children cause I love her.  Simple as that.  Not difficult
***
Well, if you plan on becoming serious with this girl..your gonna have to tell your friends. If your only seeing each other and it's not serious..I wouldn't bother.
***
what?    F those assholes.     sounds like ur one of them
***
High class does not mean they have any class. So don't tell anyone who is superficial any of your business. It will only hurt you and they never have anything positive to say.
***
It is definitely rude to ask your girlfriend not to mention her kids.  It will shake the relationship, believe me.  If you say that you don't hold the opinion of your, so called "friends", you don't have to worry, it's your life, isn't it?

Frequency produces more milk better than the length of time you pump. TRUST ME. Make sure you have a good pump. Not every pump is for every woman. The best kind is the hospital-grade ones from the hospital (you can rent them), that way they empty your breasts in like half the time! They are most efficient to being like the baby emptying your breast. TRUST ME get a good pump! I JUST went through exactly what you are talking about a month ago and I didn't have a good pump in time and no matter what I did my milk supply went away after a couple weeks. Also if you take the herb fenugreek (or however you spell it) it helps increase your milk supply. My lactation consultant told me that and gave me a handout--so let me assure you it is safe. But really, you need a hospital grade pump. Make sure when you pump it is not painful.
***
Da...thunderpants Maybe I can give you a hand.
***
it depends on how often you use your pump. because the more you use it the more your milk will stimulate and your milk will flow easier. you just have to keep working at it and don't give up, just keep trying. (Mother 0f 3 breastfed kids.)
***
I used a breastpump for the first 4 months so that I could go out if needed without having to worry about breastfeeding too often. First I used a manual Avent Isis. It took me 45 minutes to express an ounce of milk. It was tiring. So then I got an electric double breastpump by Medela. It is expesive, but it works! I use it for 10 minutes and I'm done. I can express 3-5 onces from each breast. 

The problem with the manual pump, especially if you are first time mom, is that it doesn't stimulate a let down. If you know how to stimulate a let down by yourself, then a manual pump will work out just fine.
***
FIRST feed your baby...a little bit on each side per feeding.  THEN, go pump out whatever milk you have left, on both sides.  The more you feed and pump, the more milk your body will (usually) produce.  It's all about supply and demand.  drink LOTS and LOTS of water through out the day....so much that you start to feel like a fish in water!  Hydration also produces milk.  If after you do this for a few days, you still don't feel like you are producing what you would like to, talk to your doctor OR go to your local health food store and enquire about remedies they can recommend to help increase your milk production.  It could also just be that you are not a big producer....not everybody is.
***
Tried a pump, it hurt like the dev*l! I used my hand to express the milk. Once you get the hang of it, it"s really fast. Hold four fingers under breast like you are supporting it, with the thumb on the top side push towards nipple. Work from outside towards the nipple. Working around the breast. Good luck.
***
Are you just pumping while you're separated from your baby, or are you exclusively pumping instead of nursing?  If you've been nursing your baby with no problems, then it's doubtful that you're not producing enough milk.  Many women have difficulty pumping.  Remember that your baby is much more efficient at getting milk from your body than any breastpump.  Your body has to learn to produce milk for the pump.  What sort of pump are you using?  If you're going to be regularly separated from your baby (like full-time work), then ideally you should use a double electric breast pump.  You'll need to pump at least as often as your baby will nurse, for about 15-20 minutes, and you'll probably get better results if you pump both breasts simultaneously.  If you're just trying to get milk for the occasional bottle, then you could try pumping on one side while nursing your baby on the other.  Your baby will get your milk flowing and you'll probably be more successful.  Other good times to pump are first thing in the morning (your milk supply is naturally highest at night and early morning), or after taking a shower/bath (the warm water helps to stimulate your milk to let down).  You can collect milk from several pumping sessions to get enough.  Remember that a breastfed baby only needs 2-3 ounces at a time, so you don't need to "fill" a bottle.  If your baby is a newborn and you don't have to pump, it's probably best to just concentrate on nursing and establishing your milk supply.  You can always try to pump again in a few weeks once your milk supply is better established.  Even if you pump and immediately nurse, there will still be milk for your baby.  See the links below for lots more ideas.
***
Try drinking plenty liquids (water and juice).  It can be frustrating but hang in there.  One day I went to the mall and i could feel i was very full(that hurt feeling)because i had not feed yet and when i went and sat in the car and I filled one of the bottles that come with the pump in least than 5 mins.  If you massage your breast close to your chest that will stimulate your milk ducts.

QUESTION: what kind of make-up would look good on a thirteen-year-old with curly brown hairand green eyes? i don't want to wear a lot and look like a tart. just a little to enhance my features...etc. what colours would suit me? bring out my eyes etc.
ANSWERS: 
Very little
for your eyes something soft and sheer in a mauve or lilac.
maybe a soft peachy  or rosy blush.
i would suggest a lipgloss and never ever lipstick or lipliner.
If you really need mascara try a brown shade.
It's nice to start dressing up but remember to keep it light and age appropriate. Also to wash it off at night.
***
If I was you, I would go for Sheer, shimmery colors. Dont go for dark colors because you will end up looking weird because you are still young. In my opinion Maybelline makes great products and they are coming out with all sorts of great Light colors for people. So I would go for a light purple such as a sheer lavender with shimmer. Stay away from Glitter, young people tend to put it on and it looks ridiculous. If you want a sparkle, go for shimmer, its pretty and wont make you stand out.  Light lip glosses go well too, such as a clear or light sheer pink color, bonne belle makes good cheap lipglosses for people your age. You could also try a Light colored silver eyeliner with a little shimmer in it, that will look great!
***
you are kind of young to put makeup .. beside it's not good for you skin
***
Since green eyes are really gorgeous, I say bring them out more by using a volumizing brown(for day)/black(for evening)mascara. I am also a 13 year old and I were mascara to bring out the beauty in my eyes. If you want to do eye shadow, purple will look good with your green eyes.
***
here sweety  here is your solution
medium/ light brown liner only on bottom 
ONLY light shimmery shadow on top then go aroung the liner on bottom with shimmery shadow
black mascara you'll look great it will bring attention to your green eyes but make your hair stand out too
***
Put a pale shimmery purple on your lid, and a swipe or two of brown mascara on your top lashes. Lipgloss with a little medium pink tint will be nice for your coloring, too. I'd skip everything else for a couple of years. Thirteen is a tough age for make-up. Most girls look like they're trying too hard, and you don't want to be one of THOSE. Ew. :)
***
try a bit of brown mascara and orange lip gloss. i think orange would really match your eyes and hair.
***
i'd say green eye shadow and brown lipstick.
***
You are young...so you are right in that you dont want to look like a tart! Here are some natural enhancers that you could use, and still look pretty and fresh! Your eyes...well lucky you they are GREEN! A very nice deep purple shade of eyeliner, or eyeshadow could bring them out beautifully! Only line your lash line, and slightly extend out at the tips. Another beauty enhancer for you is Lavender eyeshadow! Try it out...a pale shimmery shade of lavender or lilac and wear it from eyes to eyebwrows! Then mascara black or brown and that is it for the eyes.

For lips keep them simple...because you are bringing out your eyes! Wear a gloss only! Berry shades (dark berry or wine) will look beautiful with your Brown hair, if you are cool skinned. If you are warm skinned, wear a shade of gold pink, peach or coral gloss. You will know your skin tone by tan (olive) yellow (asian) or cool (pink) undertones. This will define the shades for make up. Lastly if you want to add spark... take your front section only and add a natural blond shade throughout your curls in very fine textured highlights...(look through mags or talk to stylist) like two or three wisps only. You want it to look like the sun did it, or add a few strands of bright red highlights for a fun and daring look. You have great coloring....you dont need much! Just use these tips for enhancement...but try to look natural (or more natural at least until you turn like, 16!
***
Stick with lip gloss at your age. It's the most flattering, because your face is probably young and nice enough looking that you won't need too much makeup. I used to wear lip gloss all the time when I was 13. Go for more expensive brands than the ones aimed at teens for a more longlasting look. Experiment a bit to find the perfect shade for your skin tone.
***
No makeup would look fabulous on you. The natural and no makeup look is all the rage with youths. A little lipgloss is fine but eyeshadow, mascara, et cetera is a little too much now. Your face will thank you for it when you're older.

QUESTION: does your spouse buy you christmas presents with your money? several years ago i got a computer for christmas from my wife. it was really great. what i didn't know was she bought it through the company i work for and i suddenly had an unexpected $125 a month coming off my pay cheque. the thought was great but the appearance of the bill was disturbing. has this type of thing ever happened to you?
ANSWERS: 
No, because i really don't want any store bought gift. Just being able to see his face in the morning. Just to hear the laughter in his voice. And to feel his warmth. And most of all just for that quality time he set aside for me makes it all good.
***
No. My wife is a working lady with her own income. As such, what ever gifts she purchases for me is presumed to have been purchased from her account.
***
No we don't adopt such techniques!
***
No, I would not do something like this.  If something is going to be coming off of my husbands check then I would tell him first.  That's a decision that should be made together and not a 'Surprise'.  Yes it's the thought that counts but not a very wise decision.  Never-the-less we are human but hopefully if this disturbed you your wife will not do something like that again.  Remember, life is a learning experience!
***
its the thought that counts! does she not contribute to the bills! clean your house! take care of your kids! i dont personally have my own $ as i watch the kids and he works so al the presents even his are technicially from him!! family!!!
***
if they are my spouse than it is both of our money regardless of who earned it.
***
Well my husband always say that his money is our money and I am on Maternity leave right now so whatever gift he gets will come from his money. I do not think he will mind as long as he gets something under the tree.
***
Well first of all if she is a stay at home mom then she has no way of providing any income so yes she should be able to buy you some christmas presents with money you have earned because she slaves to keep both of your home clean takes care of the childern and makes sure the bills are paid on time. She does alot of work that most people take for granted and you shouldnt make her feel as if she is not worthy or doesnt do enough to be able to buy a few gifts!!
***
no  cause they should have there own money
***
Well now I guess that depends on how you look at it.  No I don't buy him gifts that appear as a deduction from his check but how different is that rom seeing the same gift show up on a credit card?  Should she of done that without speaking to you first?  I'd say no but it appears her heart was in the right place.  Explain to her that you would like to be made aware of "surprises" like that in the future but I hope you also thanked her for thinking of such a great gift for you.

QUESTION: both in love beyond words...cant be together...do i let go? we are both in love, more than i thought possible, but he has gone back to his wife and kids for their sake, hes not happy but cant cause more pain.  they do not have a physical relationship.  we still see each other and there are no promises made, but i truly doubt in my heart he will stay married after the kids are out of the house in 5 years or so.  do i keep a relationship, constantly reminded of how much i love and miss him when we are not together, having faith that it will work out in the end, or just cut it off completely, end the relationship, and try to move on.  i am not that young and have plenty of life experiences so this is not an infatuation.
ANSWERS: 
I understand what you are going through and it is the hardest thing to do is to love someone that you can't be with. We both know that the best thing we can do is move on in life but for the hope of true love we don't. So we just enjoy the few minutes that we have with each other and hope that is enough. Love hurts in so many ways but no way can be worst then being without the one you do love. The best thing is to let go and hope that time will stop the pain.
***
If he is so in love with you, he would leave his wife and see his kids, whenever he wanted.  Alot of men and women, use their kids, to keep from hurting the ones that they are using.  If you choose to spend the next five years waiting on him, then you are the  one missing out on life.  He has a life with his wife and kids and you are put on the back burner.  If you are not that young, then get out and find someone who is not married and get on with your life.  You would really be a fool, to wait 5 years on someone, who may never leave his family for you.  If they weren't having a physical relationship, his wife would know that there is someone else in his life and if she's smart, he would ask him to leave.  Think about this, would you truth him, if he were to leave her?  If he is messing with you, while he is married, what makes you think, he wouldn't find someone else, to mess with, when and if you two get together?  If I were you, I would leave him and move on with my life.  Find someone, that deserves your love.
***
a true love is worth a million life but in your case from his side it does not seem so if you still feel he is worth you you can wait a million years to get a true love 

but i still have a feeling ur wait is not worth u might love him but is he worth that love ask urself u will get the answer as you are the best person to judge 
if you still feel we can discuss ur problem in detail u can mail me
***
I think the best thing to do is to have a heart to heart dicussion with this guy. Let him know your feeling towards this relationship and please understand his positions as well. I can see from your explanation that you would like, if possible, to marry him. It's okay, but make sure he feels the same way towards you. It will be so disastrous if eventually you are faced with a big disappointment afterwards. Cheers!
***
I'm so sorry. This sounds like a very difficult situation, but something tells me that your heart is already pulling you one way or the other and you are just searching for validation. What does he say about it? Does he even want you to wait around for him or have you talked to him about it at all? I think if you do a little research into what his true feelings are and stay confident enough to listen to the little voice inside your head, you will have the answer to your question. I hope everything works out for you. I will be cheering for you all the way!
***
For your own sanity, I would suggest ending the relationship. As much as you do love him and he may love you as well, he is holding up to his responsibilties to his family, which is commendable. Give him that much. If you two are destined to be together, it will all work out. But in 5 years or so, will you be happy with being the other woman? Are you content with that? You deserve a chance at life. If the two of you are truly meant to be together, your paths will cross when the timing is right again. It doesn't mean you have to stop loving him, but you do need to go on with your own life. 

There may be someone else that steals your heart in the meantime, and you may find happiness with someone else. Who knows? But give yourself the chance at happiness as well. Living the next 5 years in suspence, waiting, wondering and not knowing, is no way to live. Go by ech day doing what you need to do for yourself. There's nothing to say that you and this guy won't end up together in the end. But in the meantime, you can't hold on to something you already know isn't possible in the present.
***
i woudl say keep in touch but not to serious now , wait until he settles himself to see wat he wants as well i mean if u guys are both in love then there shouldnt be a reason not to still keep in touch and see eachother and one day he will have to explain things to the kids and everything but you only live life once right why not make the best of it and go for it!!
***
You know it is woman like you that makes me sick. You know he is married and you keep trying to be with him. Don't give me this shit there isn't anything going on with them. I was the wife with the husband that went out and cheated and you know he was still having sex with me. If you want to be the blind other woman then go for it. To tell you the truth if you was smart you would just get out and if he really don't love his wife then he will leave her for good. Don't put Ur's in the middle. It really isn't far to the wife or yourself. MEN LIE and believe me I know. My thing is dose the wife know about you?? If not then maybe you should tell her who are and you will see how fast he leaves her for you... Don't be upset if he don't move out for you.
***
Why can't he be with you, live with you and just be there for the kids? They are pretty big, they will understand... so many families are like that now...

otherwise, if you are completely certain that you will be together in 5 years, that he is the man of your life and that you want to sacrifice yourself till then...go ahead

Take care

QUESTION: kidney failure? my mother is suffering of kidney failure but she is not at the point of dialysis yet but she has too much protein in her urine.  does anyone know of anything that helps get rid off protein in the urine for someone suffering of kidney failure.  at this stage, food is not an issue that has been confirmed by a specialist. . .
ANSWERS: 
The protein in the urine is a symptom of the kidney failure.  Kidney failure can be caused by many things. If that cause can be taken care of, then maybe the kidney can recover.  For example, if your mom has a kidney infection, then maybe she can regain kidney function.  I have been a dialysis technician for a year, so I'm not an expert, but I know a little.  

In my time as a dialysis tech, I've seen 2 people regain kidney function.  The people it happened to, regained function after a few months on dialysis.  The longer the problem persists, the more damage is done to the kidneys, the less likely it is that function can return.

It is important to know that if your mom's kidneys cannot regain function, and she is treated with dialysis, her world has not ended.  Dialysis is a very effective life prolonging /sustaining treatment.  If your mom eats healthy, controls her fluid intake, and doesn't skip treatments, she can live a long time.  Depending on age, previous health condition, etc., people can live for another 10-15 years on dialysis.  I know people who have been on it since they were teenagers and now have grandchildren.

The important thing is to take it all one step at a time.  Listen to your doctors and NEVER stop asking questions.  Don't be afraid or embarassed to ask for second opinions. There are lots of resourves out there, like the National Kidney Foundation. The people who don't survive are generally the ones who don't care, who don't want to know anything, who don't want to follow the advice of healthcare professionals.
***
It is necessary to treat the underlying condition that is causing proteinuria. For example, when diabetes or hypertension is present, treatment involves controlling blood pressure with the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE-I) inhibitor, like captopril (capoten®). Ace inhibitors prevent the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, a substance that normally causes the veins to constrict. The result is a reduction in blood pressure. 

The goal is to reduce blood pressure below 130 systolic and 80 diastolic. After bun, creatinine, and potassium are monitored for 7 to 10 days, ace inhibitors are gradually increased to avoid side effects. The degree of proteinuria is checked periodically and typically improves with every dose. 

It is necessary to monitor blood sugar, salt intake, diet, and exercise.
***
water helps the kidneys. you will have to check with a doctor. what might work perfect for someone, might kill another.
***
the protein is in the urine because the kidneys arent fitlering correctly, which is the problem youre trying to correct... unfortunately, theres not much you can do outside of a transplant

QUESTION: how long would it take america to supply what china makes for us now? since china is the "wild card" nation, what would happen if she closed her ports? how long would it take america to produce and manufacture what we now purchase from china? would it even be practical at this point considering the state of our own limited manufacturing capability? i mean if things really hit the fan, wouldn't we be in a real fix?
ANSWERS: 
yes
i guess
US has more emphasize on service industry which is wrong.....in the long run.
***
Actually we could start producing very quickly. Much we already produce. The issue is not that the US has a limited manufacturing capability (as they do not) but goods from China are considerably cheaper to but from them than produce them here. The difference in currency exchange rates makeds the ability to buy goods cheaper from China.
***
no time to replace that crap. Most of them are made by labors living in filth and subsidised by Govt. the quality of most of is junk anyway. China is a bubble which is going to burst in the next 2 years
***
money is the issue, we can't produce things at the price China can due to labor laws.  but what do they make that we really need?

QUESTION: how can i get rid of gallstones without having surgery? i was just diagnosed with gallstones in my gallblatter i really dont want to have surgery and have been told that there are other ways to get rid of the stones so if anyone knows how im open for suggestions
ANSWERS: 
Most gallstones are made of pure cholesterol.  You might try a diet with low fat and very low saturated fats.  Reducing the saturated fats will lower blood cholesterol and may (I'm not promising anything!) make the stones smaller.

Lowering your total fat intake may also help reduce or prevent pain.  Gallstones hurt because when you eat fat, the stomach senses it and tells the gallbladder to release some of the gall into the intestines to help digest the fat.  If you have stones, that squeezing is about like squeezing a handfull of pointy rocks.

However...   I've had the surgery and it really isn't a big deal.  There is minimal scarring and the incisions aren't that much bigger than a bug bite or a medium sized zit.  

If you leave the gallstones there, they can get large enough to damage the gallbladder, with the result of a bad infection and that can cause death, which is a very Bad Thing!
***
They now have a way of zapping them with sound that caused them to shatter instead of operating.  I don't know the details though.
***
If you really want to seek other alternatives I would look into finding a holistic store near you and maybe call and ask if they have any organic remedies.... usually a reg. doc. wont tell you those type of remedies because its not considered western medicine.... good luck
***
Have you seen a gastroenterologist?  They can do a minimally invasive procedure called an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography - try saying that 3 times fast!).  An ERCP won't get rid of the stones that are in the gallbladder...just the stones that are stuck in the duct leading from the GB to the small intestine.  They can make a tiny cut in the duct and pull gallstones out with a small balloon.  If the stone is too large, they have equipment that will crush the stone so it will pass freely.  

I had the surgery myself about 10 years ago.  It's not as bad as you'd imagine, and you feel much better after it's over.  You might still have phantom pain for a while, but it's nowhere near as bad as the pain you started with.  

Eating a diet high in fat will make gallbladder disease worse, but you can't really get rid of the stones unless they pass naturally or you have them removed, either in surgery or with an ERCP.
***
The best remedy is surgury. I had surgery to have kidney stones removed. The surgery isn't as bad as you think it may be.

jesus plays both parts (sons) in john 5,
which thereby also has two resurrections.

which son should repent(change)?
(hint: numbers 23:19)
ANSWERS: 
check sunnah and Quran

whose god are you shewing?  that sounds far out there-- 
two resurrections??? don't think so.
don't read between the lines-- its insanity.

Sorry, you lost me at two resurrections.

Son of Man is not a destroyer.  The Son of Man is the central character in the books of Enoch, and plays the role of saving mankind from demonic attack.

Early Christians were quite familiar with these stories and integrated them into their theology.  Most of what Christians think about Satan, devils, etc., actually comes from the books of Enoch, not the Bible.

U have any idea what u r talking about?

Jesus has already saved us all.... it is upto us if we want to accept Him or not.

"Courage is not the lack of fear. It is acting in spite of it." -- Mark Twain

Courage made artists and inventors break the mold of a way of thinking. Courage kept Beethoven composing and directing even after he had gone dead. Courage allowed Galileo to continue with his experiments even though his head was on the line. Courage inflamed the heart of Florence Nightingale to tend to the wounded and dying in the middle of a horrible war. Courage is what Gandhi showed by refusing to use violence.

QUESTION: can you get pregnant after a tubal? i had a tubal 16 months ago after the birth of my son because my husband was abusive but since then i have left him and found a wonderful man we would love to have a baby togather but i want to know if its possible
ANSWERS: 
It's possible, but not likely. My aunt did get pregnant after ehr tubal, and had a son. Most likely though if you want more kids, you will need to have a tubal reversal. I've done a lot of research on reversal docs, feel free to IM me sometime if you want more info about reversals.
***
well probsbly not but you can pay to get then untie it cost a lot
***
The decision for tubal ligation or having your tubes tied should be considered a permanent decision. Still, it is possible to conceive after this procedure. 

A recent study showed that an alarming percentage of women who had had the procedure conceived accidentally. This problem has been remedied by cutting, tying and burning the ends of the fallopian tubes. 

If you want to actively reverse this there are two options. The first is to have surgery to rejoin the tubes. This does not have a very high success rate. At best, it is up to 60%. If there are any other problems, such as short remaining tubes, or other damage to them, the rates are quite low. The rate of success is decreased for women whose tubes have been burned, due to more extensive tubal damage. There is also a much greater risk of ectopic pregnancy with rejoined tubes. This is because there is often scarring and narrowing of the tubes where they are rejoined. The ovum may be too large to pass through the constricted portion, yet it can still be fertilized. Success has also been found to depend on the age of the woman, the technique of ligation, tubal length after rejoining, and if one or both tubes are rejoined. 

The second option is in vitro fertilization. This also has a low success rate. It can vary with the clinic involved, but generally it is between 10-25%. It also carries the possibility of an increased risk of ovarian cancer. The woman must be given doses of female hormones to stimulate the production of several eggs in one cycle. This large dose of hormones is thought to be the cause of cancer in some women twenty or thirty years after the procedure. The studies are not yet clear on this issue, because we haven't been doing this procedure on enough people to know for certain. 



GOOD LUCK
***
there is a surgical procedure where you can get your tubal reversed....It's expensive & not that effective in restoring fertility & your other alternative is in vitro which is also expensive/only partially effective, but it's worth a try.
***
Yes, but you'll have to have surgery to have them "untied."

QUESTION: those who do not believe in god: mock him to his face.? considering the stories i read about those who mocked god and died, i thought it would be interesting to dare atheists to do the same. okay. so, you don't believe in god. i dare all atheists, then, to mock him. in particular, you all should challenge him to stop you from doing something, preferably while insulting him. say that god can't do it, and see what happens.
ANSWERS: 
Why are you trying to sow dissent here?  There are people on here trying to keep it less like a battlefield and more like a place for important questions on faith, and questions like this don't help.
***
why would you mock something you don't believe in?
***
you are acting like a little child ,i dare god to strike you down with a bolt of lightning 

,do you feel any thing yet.

i thought not ,and your god is not a god ,he cloned Adam in his own image ,and Adam was a normal guy .Eva in turn was cloned from Adam and she was also not a goddess.

this space commander has a lot of blood on his hands ,and apart from being an exstraterestial he was foreign to boot.and he is a rookie having been here barely 6000 years ago.

And the story of being welcome in his garden on the condition that you were dead i find very strange .even stranger than so many people buying this,

I tell you what ,if you renounce your eroneuos ways ,and ask forgiveness for betraying Baal and Gaia the only rightfull gods of this planet for billions of years,

and if you bring several bottles of your best wine ,you will be welcome in our Paradise ,right now ,here on earth 

And the good news is that you dont have to die ,the bad news is that you have to do some weeding and planting ,but that is good for the soul.

And as you seem to have his ear, 
better tell your God ,
to watch it  because
we are the Pee Pees 
the people of Pan
we care for our Planet
where ever we can
you beat us ,you robbed us

you rendered us weak
but we will be back
for we are

Why? Why bother answering this; athiests don't believe in God or a God of any kind. This question is completely futile; asking this question would be directed toward agnostics on the verge of becoming athiests or people who are anti-Christian/Catholic/etc. Someone who says 'my god is better than yours' is the perfect person to ask this question to.
***
thank god for the 2
***
well i dont think God will want to kill every athiest, because He cares about all of His children and dosnt want any of them to go to hell. he would feel pity for them and probably give them a chance to be saved. sounds like you've misunderstood God quite a bit. thats not how he operates at all.
***
I mock god to stop me from posting this question.
Guess I'm more powerful
***
You really shouldn't do this. Christians are supposed to encourage people to believe in Jesus and trust in God. Why would you encourage them to hurry their damnation?

Having said that, what you are doing is so immature that I would not expect God to play along for your amusement. Grow up.
***
ok!
God can't make me throw up! He doesn't exist!


*whistles* I'm waiting lol
***
Why don't you do something productive to your faith such as telling others about his life and his sacrifice instead of doing this whole "my God is bigger than your God!!" thing? This sounds an awful bit like a playground conversation: "I DARE you to kick over my sand castle, Susy!". Get over yourself.
***
I think most people are more in question than denial, but why instigate? Rather leave the subject be.
***
I don't believe in a God..any God but I won't mock your God because its your right to believe it, just don't mock me or try to push your beliefs on me when I don't believe.  If you actually believed in God you wouldn't have asked that question.  Go with Fish
***
what you dont understand is for an athiest to mock god they would have to admit he exists, dont really feel like talking to myself. that just makes me feel stupid. there is a difference in not believing and hating. to insult someone insinuates that you hate them, who am i insulting if i dont believe in him? ponder that for a while, if you have a relative answer, may your so called god strike me down with all his might
***
I wouldn't mock him if I could see his face, or if there was, oh, i don't know, maybe SOME kind of concrete evidence.  But wait, there isn't, now is there?  God's not real, there's my mocking.  If he is real, he won't let this pen i'm holding touch the ground when I drop it.  I just dropped it, and it hit the ground.
***
Careful with God, what makes you believe that God will listen to you!
***
Jesus said if you beleive in me believe also in My Father, dare we call Jesus a lyer as man is??
***
why start?
***
People tend to scoff at god and the writers of the bible. That bothers me! I wish the were alive or real to scoff in their faces.
***
God can't save my son from his disease, histiocytosis. Chemotherapy will.

And if God wants to come down, I will mock him to his face.
***
mocking a person's religion is a bad thing to do and you should be ashamed of yourself while i am an atheist i do have moral and my principles forbid me to mock another person's beliefs

QUESTION: relationship advice? okay, here's the thing. this girl broke up with me last year. now i have a new girlfriend who i love very much. however, i got an email reminder of the first's birthday yesterday, with a note saying, "i do still love her." apparently, i saved that last year after she broke up with me when i still had feelings for her. anyway, when i read that, it almost felt like it was telling me that i do still love her, even just a little bit. but i love my girlfriend now...but what do i do? (preferably to get my mind off the one who broke up with me)...oh, yeah, she told me she still has feelings for me, too...but i told her i didn't because i didn't at the time, but now i'm not so sure. advice?
ANSWERS: 
Figure out whom you really have feelings for first and then make your choice and let both of them know what you've decided.
***
Maybe your just thinking about the good times. Focus on why your not together to this day. What made your relationship end. Don't be blinded by the good times,its OK to still have feelings. And the one major issue man you still have a girlfriend and you said you love her. Don't just hurt her like that,you've been there and have done that.
***
you seem better off with the girl you have now.  This girl makes you forget about the other one. That is fantastic.  Just forget about the ex.
***
She's an Ex and a part of your past.....leave her there!
***
Since you have ur second girlfriend come in at the time you were not in a proper emotional state, it would be wise of you to give some time for yourself and think seriously about whom you would like to spend the rest of your life with and then make appropriate decisons.
***
First of all, its better for suggestions here and not advice.  

Now, if it was only an email reminder that you left on your computer, then maybe you dont still love her.  You can still have fond feelings and even a bit of love for her, yet you say you love the one you are with.  Then love her and let the past stay in the past.

Its better to move on that to hang on to something that took off a long time ago.  Enjoy the love that you share with the woman you are with now and let the other go completely.  After all, it has been a year right?

Theres no way to get the one woman out of your head completely though.  There will always be those little times that the one/ ones you thought you loved will always pop in your mind.  The only thing one can do really is move on in life.
***
Forget about the first girl. The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence you know? If it was meant to be it would have worked out the first time. If you love the girl you're with, be content with that.
***
You're one messed up dude. Search your feelings and decide once and for all. And then do the right thing based on what you decide.

Saying you have feelings for your old GF and she to you is just that - SOME feelings - that you may still love her just a little bit. Is that enough to break up with your current GF? How much do you love your current GF? More or less than your old GF? It is normal to reminisce about old loves and how you used to feel about. Remember, the key word is used to.Good luck to you. I hope you work it out and decide.
***
The grass always seems greener on the other side. But it's really not.
***
Ok, if she broke up with you that's her loss and you need to get over her. If you love this new girl you got then ignore TOG!!! Don't let TOG (the old girl) mess it all up for you!!!!
***
remember she is your ex for a reason! sometimes we long for old relationships but that turns out to be stupid! I went back to an ex and left the most amazing man.. the ex had cheated on me and lied to me! fast forward a year later two months before the wedding i found out he cheated again! I met another man and married him now and four years later am has happy as I can be!!

QUESTION: why are bassoons so expensive? i was looking at bassoons over at musician's friend ( http://www.musiciansfriend.com/bo/navigation?page=1&n=100001+305585&ns=p_price%7c0 ) and am wondering why they cost $2500-$14,000.

does anyone know?
thanks
m98s
ANSWERS: 
They are hand made from excellent and expensive wood.  The wood pieces must be structurally perfect in large sizes and are rare.  They take FAR longer to make than any other instrument.

The cheap plastic ones aren't that much more than other instruments.  Also, they are far less popular, so there is a volume/demand issue as well.

because they are so beautiful and probably have to be individually made and such.

QUESTION: am i at fault here? i met a young lady on hotornot.com, and we hit it off. we haven't met, but we've im'd back and forth quite a bit, and some of the conversations became, well, a bit steamy!

during some of our first communications on hot or not's website, she clearly told me she was 18 years old (i've saved these messages). regrettably, as a result of some independent research i've conducted, i have learned that she is only 17. 

so my question is really two-fold: am i at "fault" here, and what's the best way for me to extricate myself from this situation? she doesn't know that i know, and we're still on friendly terms.

also - and i don't know if this would have any bearing on the situation - but the age of consent in her state is 16.
ANSWERS: 
You haven't done anything illegal YET, so your best course of action is to withdraw from further contact with her now. Tell her "I'm sorry, I know you're only 17 so I can't continue talking to you." Whatever you do, DON'T MEET HER!

QUESTION: how do i get her to do this? my church was watching a movie for a teen event and i sat next to the girl i like (p.s. its a scary movie) and she grabed her friends hand (girl) when she got scared



how do i get her to grab my hand when she is scared?
ANSWERS: 
Well,you could try sitting inbetween her and her friend. Then maybe they would BOTH grab your hand!!!! Good Luck
***
Charm her girlfriends to leave, or ask one of your friends to intervene. When she is scared she might grab your hand by mistake, then say a line to let her know u don't mind her doing that
***
Make sure no one sits next to her except you!!!
***
Most girls don't grab STRANGERS hands when watching a scary movie......Make yourself known.  Introduce yourself, DON'T BE A STRANGER.  Get to know her and make her feel comfortable around you.  Next thing you know she might be usingyou as a shield for the movie screen.
***
lol...be a friend to her just like the other firend?...or touch her sometime...but non chalantly...so you guys get in this comfortable touching zone...talk to her and grab her hand and look at her ring and say i like that or somethign...long as you do it smooth and not clumsy...something of that nature...an then weigh her reaction out...if she looks weirded out by you touching her dont do it anymore...and try to use charm and friendly smiles when talkin to her...
***
Say something to her like, "I get frightened easily. Can I hold your hand at the scary parts?"

Or make sure her friend isn't there next time.
***
Get her drunk.
***
be her best friend and more
***
when you go on a date don't bring her friends along.
***
Bro... You've got to take things one step at a time. Allow her to get to know you. Once she is comfortable with your companionship, you will see the difference. But never take advantage of the situation. God bless.

QUESTION: 1999 chevy blazer, headlights!!!? on a friends 99 blazer,. his headlight's stopped working? the other day they worked only when it was in drive, but when he put it park they would go ff, now they do not work at all, all new bulbs, all the rear lights work, we hooked a 12v tester to the light sockets and they are getting power,the orange blinker lights work on the front but no headlights...any ideas, oh and we have checked all the fuses......anyone have a problem like this.??
ANSWERS: 
Check out the head light relay. Insure you have good clean tight grounds
***
Does this thing have daytime running lights? The voltage gets dropped by a resistor.

Is he turning the light switch on even tho he has daytime running lights?

Do they work on bright?

Some systems will have power going to the light and use the ground to turn on the lights, thru the switch. So you may see power there, but the bulbs still won't light.
***
did he changed the bulbs on both side? i the same problem with my Chevy  lumina when i changed both side i worked.

QUESTION: change from 6 volt to 12 volt? to change 6 volt to 12 volt will it make the car run faster or take off faster?what i have to replace when i change from 6-12 volts?what eles i have to do beside replace the battery?
ANSWERS: 
Current vehicles use 12 volt systems and it's been a while since I've heard of a 6 volt system. You would need to change the whole electrical system, not just the battery. There would be no real advantage in performance and conversion cost is high.
***
It will not run faster ,you could find a higher amp generator, pertronix makes a 6volt pointless ignition system now,and you could find on eBay a variable regulator from the 50's.
***
what kinda car are you talking about?
***
It will make the engine crank faster but not run any differently. You will need to replace your starter, generator, voltage regulator and lights. You will need to add a resister(s) if you want to use your original gages and radio. If not, these will need to be replaced too. If this is a positive ground system, you will need to do some wiring to make it all work right.
***
No real difference in performance - and if it is six volt now, it is an real antique, and changing it to twelve volt will take away from the value of the vehicle.

Six volt simply was not that good, it was not adequate, but it did still work.  I would leave it as it is, original - but that is me - as you seem to think the car will run faster - no, it may start a little easier.  

Oh by the way, your starter, lights, fuses, alternator, winched wiper blade motors, coil, points... anything electrical would probably have to be changed - but you would have to ask a real mechanic anyways before you started, and even then they probably would not be sure.

An old car club would be your best source for information.

   any better suggestions!!!!! i really need an answer.. help!!!!!!!! love you guys
ANSWERS: 
just get the number
***
if you want to talk to this guy, get his phone number, otherwise he has the choice not to use your number.
***
he'll just be happy that you consider him attractive.

A girl giving me her Number.

ok... you lil teenie bopper... gert a fucking life stand up and shot yourself for the one you love...
***
Give him your number.

ask for his number and he'll think it's your way out of making any future contact with him...having someone else do it makes you look like your a loser and too scared to do it yourself...give him your number...he'll appreciate it
***
if you like him too much go for it and ask him for his number but don't push too much let him know you then wait a while if he feel the same he will call you back

let him call u
this way  u wont sound desperate 
as well as u can be in control of the relationship if that is what u want

QUESTION: marriage, who should ask? what do you think about a woman asking the man to marry them? is that wrong? i heard a woman can do this on a leap year? lol. i guess you could any year but i want to know if it matters who asks who? what do ya think?
ANSWERS: 
go for it.
thats a great idea.
infact i respect your decision.

okey. as said , its the tradition 
of a man to ask a lady to marry him.
but i guess culture is changing as we grow. 
as of this days, you wont be suprised to see a lady proposing to a man. that will depend on the love they 
share both. infact i like it when a lady is the one to propose. 
when there is love, nothing will befall in between.
there is nothing wrong a woman proposing to a guy.

be inspired and go for it.
***
I think it depends on the person. If you are courageous, do it. It should not matter who does the asking if you both love each other and are committed to each other. I personally don't know if I could ever be that brave, but wish I were. Go for it. It shouldn't matter.
***
Well my husband ask me after two week of dating then forgot he ask after one year of living together lol but we are together I mean married now going on 14 years I did ask the after that year lol
***
I don't see anything wrong with the woman asking the man to marry him.
***
its not wrong.she can ask
***
If you can not have a good sex with anyone , you must ask to marriage...!!!!!
***
if yove got a romantic guy then the bloke should
***
its good but u have to see tha=e man by his additute and not his looks or style because if u go on that u can get in alot of of troble next so juge him by his additute and the one u accully like go on ask him thats not wrong.GOOD LUCK girl!!!!!!lol
***
It has been more common 4 a man 2 ask cause he is suppose 2 b the one that takes care of u. So it would be like saying that he wants 2 take on that respsobility. But it doesnt never say that a woman couldnt do it.
***
It doesn't matter who pops the question. Love knows no boundries, so a woman should feel comfortable asking a man "the question." Now, are you going to present an engagement ring when you ask him?
***
she should have her head examined
***
I think if a guy really wants to marry a chick he would ask her, if she asks him he's gonna feel pressured and you probably won't get a truthful answer
***
anyone I would ask my bf if I feel that I am so sure I want to spend the rest of my life with him things like that can be a shock but takes the pressure off the man
***
Traditionally it's the guy who asks the woman to marry him, can't say I've ever heard of a woman asking a man to marry her.

But, it's your decision, go for it.
***
I think that it is great.
***
It don't matter who ask who, as long as you love one another, that is all that really matters!!! good luck
***
I think the minister, justice of the peace, priest, or other clergy will ask. But if you are compelled and it won't upset you later in years, go for it!
***
Go for it girl, get down on your knee and ask him.  If he says no, you are no worse off than waiting for him to ask. For a Hot Blonde like yourself, he would have to be totally blind or insane to refuse you.  Well done, I honestly think it is marvelous, beautiful and romantic.

QUESTION: i had to have an iv put in my hand 2 wks ago & since then i have small, painful lumps in my veins, what is it? after having an iv put in my hand 2 weeks ago i noticed 2 small, very painful lumps in the veins of my hand. yesterday i noiticed i had one in my forearm. this one is tender, but not as painful as the ones in my hand. what could this be and is it related to the iv being put it or is it just coincidence that i noticed them around the time i was in the hospital? the lumps are very hard and i can actually roll them around between my fingers, although, the pain almost takes my breath away when i do so. the lump in my arm is smaller and slightly tender to the touch, but not as painful as the ones in my hand, not even close. i just now found a 2nd small lump in my arm near the other one. what are these things and should i be scared?
ANSWERS: 
These are probably just small lumps of scar tissue caused by the needle used for the IV.  Since you were in the hospital 2 weeks ago, I'll assume you are having a follow up visit with your regular doctor soon.  Have him/her check them out, but I wouldn't worry about it to much.

QUESTION: why dose tv go blank w/ like only 2 lines? i have an older well like 5 years or so old sharp 27 in tv but for some reason it keeps messing up and it cuts from full screen to like a tenth of an inch line across the center. so i have to hit it till it stays in full screen. i tried blowing it out and it helped 4 a lil but it came back with a vengence. is it time for a new tv or a lil fix, on unimployment so new wont be comming any time soon... so help me please
ANSWERS: 
It looks like you're stuck with the issue

that won't go away.  It might be in your

best interest to eventually get a brand

new TV when you are able, or you can

buy another used TV from Craigslist or

from your local classifieds that will give

you something to watch until you are

back on your feet.  Good news, now

prices have never been lower...

QUESTION: what type of bodies do men prefer (ladies too if that's ur thing)? i always think i am so fat because i am kinda tall and stocky. i am athletic and i am really strong.. i was just wondering if skinny is the only way for a guy to go.
ANSWERS: 
The general observation about men's taste in the female figure is that the lower your social class, the more flesh you prefer on the woman.  Thus, a poor man would prefer a woman with voluptuous figure, all boobs and butt, while a rich man would prefer a slimmer, more waifish woman.
***
If you can accept an answer from an "Olde Pharte" I can tell you that the 'artificial' emaciated appearance of today's television "ideal female" is a joke, and not what males (at least me) are 'after'

The idea of the "perfect" female" is a joke.

I, for one would prefer my  females to be natural in appearance, not something from "American Idol" as seen on TV.

Just musing.

Ouzinkil
***
NAKED AND WET,   PREFERRED BY MOST MALES AND SOME LADIES.
***
Im not into women or anything, but i do know that it mostly depends on what the guy likes. Some men may like super skinny girls, and some other men prefer more athletic girls, and some prefer chubby girls. Dont let anybody tell you that you have to have a certain body type to be liked by men. The most important thing on a girl is confidence!
***
Skinny was never what guys wanted. I am an 18 year old female in Australia. My boyfriend is training to be a fitness instructor and most of my friends are guys. I know for a fact that they would choose a person with a fit body over a twig. Skinny is just not attractive usually comes with alot of issues too (lets face it guys don't want to hear us bitch about being fat when we are obviously not). Healthy is the way to go. But don't forget personality is important too. Be comfortable in your own skin. And if your not then do something about it but be smart and sensible.

QUESTION: keep being called goofy and it's really hittin me now? i have a brace and my teeth aren't perfect, but they are comin along. the thing is when i start a new job or meet new people i occasionally get nasty comments behind my back like goofy's here (meaning goofy as in teeth prominant) i don't think they are that bad but i don't like it when people say stuff it really gets me down.

i'm feelin so annoyed and my self confidence is goin down hill. how do i deal with things like that, i have had it all my life since at school...name callin is for kids...but now im startin work and i get the same critical comments from people i work with....

what should i do , to not let it get to me....
ANSWERS: 
comic response. Ask them if they are suggesting doggy style if its a girl. People that make comical responses to the flaws that people point out seem to be happier because they eventually learn to enjoy their short-comings instead of feeling embarrassed by them.... sorry, can't come up with a male response... unless that works for both for you.... goofy
***
Pete I hate to tell you but people for the most part are dill-weeds. They will always have some derogatory remark to make about you or someone else. The best you can do is keep your confidence just because it will piss them off. If you over hear it I suggest you turn and say something witty. Usually after being slapped down by your confidence the stupid will generally make themselves look even dumber, shortly after realizing that every word they say is deflected by you not caring, they retreat into their own insecurities. Confidence is what they are trying to undermine don't let them win. And never reduce yourself to their asinine behavior. As you said name calling is for children but witty comebacks are for adults and if you are new to the real world (by that I mean fresh out of school) you will need to adopt the "really that is the best you can come up with" attitude. Remember your braces will come off, you have friends that will never leave your side and you my friend have the confidence of a rock star! So let the mortals dance by your feet they mean nothing in Pete's world.
***
Hm......I have two very bad knees and I have to use this really funky brace all of the time, take Glucosamine Sulfate and Naproxen Sodium. People are always calling me Crip, or Broken. It really made me mad at first, but after a while, I relized that people are just afraid of what they don't know much about. The people that are making fun of you are just ignorant. They don't know any better, and that's a shame. I used to have the worst over/cross bite you had ever seen when I was a little girl, too. When I got braces, everyone called me brace-face, metel-mouth, and all that. But I'll tell you one thing!!! I could shoot them rubber bands half way to China if I wanted. After I shot a few of them kids, they didn't make fun of me as much. What I'm trying to say is, don't let it get you down. You are who you are, and if they don't like you for that or think you're "goofy", then that's THEIR problem, not yours. They should like you for who you are, not who you pretend to be. Like you can think I'm in 9th grade or under because of my spelling, but the truth is.....I just can't spell. I'm getting ready to go to college. LOL! But I don't care any more. I would rather someone hate me for who I am then love me for who I'm not. Well. I hope that helped. Good luck!!! And when they do that to you. Just say to yourself, "I know I'm smart and awsome, and if they don't like it, then that's their problem because their the ones missing out!!!" Bye!
***
act like it doesnt bother you even if it might just laugh along with them after a while they will get bored and leave you alone but if you act like it gets to you then they will keep doing it
***
Act like goofy the comic character.  that's what they want to hear, once they see that the names are not hurting you. 'they are, but you are not showing it' it should stop, or slow down.

know how the saying goes.  Sticks and stones may break my bones, but names can never hurt me.  Well it does hurt deeply, you are showing others that it's not going to make a difference.

When you make them laugh cause of what they call you, you are changing the situation for yourself and them.. they get a laugh..  it should subside.
***
It may sound silly but ignore it and be gracious. Compliment other females on whatever you like, there hair, clothes, whatever. The idea is to show people you are more desirable as an Alie-friend than as a target. Possibly there is something they envy about you? Try being a little more out going and I think things will get better.
***
The best way to deal with it is to joke about yourself.  It will show people not only that calling you a name is pointless, but also that you are a cool enough dude to make fun of yourself a little.  They will probably end up feeling bad that they ever called you that, and being really nice in the future.  Just put yourself above it.  Good luck.
***
I would concur on treating it as a joke (maybe start wearing vests and long-sleeved turtlenecks to work?).  I do not agree with the answerer who suggested the "doggy-style" remark.  That could get you in trouble for verbal sexual harassment.

QUESTION: what does john lennon's song imagine mean to you? i heard this song again the other day, and thought "wow. this song is possibly more pertinent today than when it was written. what a great song." i just wonder what others think. 

here are the lyrics in case you have heard it in a while. 

imagine
john lennon
 
imagine there's no heaven
it's easy if you try
no hell below us
above us only sky
imagine all the people
living for today...

imagine there's no countries
it isn't hard to do
nothing to kill or die for
and no religon too
imagine all the people
living life in peace...

imagine no possesions
i wonder if you can
no need for greed or hunger
in a brotherhood of man
imagine all the people
sharing all the world...

you may say i'm a dreamer
but i'm not the only one
i hope some day you'll join us
and the world will be as one
ANSWERS: 
This song brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it.  I think it means that love can transcend all boundaries and if we only looked deep inside ourselves we'd realize we're all the same and we're fighting over stupid things.  In other words we could attain whatever our wildest dreams are.  It's a beautiful song!
***
I really dislike this song.  The tune is actually beautiful and beautifully sung by Lennon.

But even a beautifully crafted song can be incorrect.  According to Lennon, no Heaven = no God, therefore no God = no accountability to God.  

I wonder what song he sings now........
***
It means john's something of an anarchist and he's imagining a world where people are mature enough to let go of their illusions stop worrying about crap they have no control over and just live the best they can.
***
To me, it means that there is limitless possibilies for all of us.  If we can imagine it, we have the power to make it come true
***
If we can imagine that there is nothing that makes us seperate or different from eachother we could live in peace...Imagine That!!!
***
I imagine it means we should all sit around imagineing things all the time and evrything would be great. I imagine it's true.
***
imagine everything was based on facts not beliefs.imagine we really treat everyone the way we want to be treated.we are all the same, just humans.but societies try to put other cultures down.
that and many other little details,would be what the world needs to achieve peace.

QUESTION: i was wondering? ok my neice wants me to redo her computer she got from someone and when i hook it up it's got xp and whoever had it had a password at the beginning and i was wondering how to get past that to do something with it
ANSWERS: 
i had the same problem, only with multiple users and passwords, and i couldnt find which one was logged on as the administrator, so i had to re-install xp from the disc of a relative.

since you seem to mention only one password, its possible that that is the administrator, and you would have full authority to change whatever you wanted.

i don't know for sure though

try here maybe

http://www.allexperts.com/
***
a password at the very beginning at the start up... before window's even loads... open the case up and take out the little silver battery on the motherboard... leave it out for 30 seconds to a minute and put it back in... when you do so... that password will be gone
***
go to setup when the comp starts and go to security there u can remove the password
***
u must wipe hard drive and reload xp
***
First choice, find out the password from whoever she got the computer from.   Then you can change/delete from the administrator user.

Second choice, try to guess the password.  Most people don't take passwords seriously.   Try the word "password" or "admin" or just hit the enter key.  Or...

Third choice, if there is more than 1 user defined, try logging on to a different user.  Maybe all don't have passwords.  (You still need to get password for System Administrator user.)

Fourth choice, try ideas from other Answers, other sources.

Last choice, do a "Day 1" System Recovery.   This takes the pc back to the way it was when it came from the factory.  This is drastic.   But it may be your only choice.   

During the recovery process it will ask you for a password.  Just hit enter and it will leave it at "no password".

Later, you will have to catch up on all the XP security updates, and perhaps other software updates.

Good Luck
***
I guess the password comes up before the Windows are loaded correct?
If yes the only thing u can do is to reset the Bios. U can read the owner's manual but in some motherboards u just need to take the battery off.
If the password comes when the windows are loaded and u are not interested for the data on the disk ... Then why don't u format the disk and re-install Windows XP?

QUESTION: how do i quickly soften brown sugar? i want to make some cookies but my brown sugar is hard, any ideas? also, does anyone have a great chocolate chip cookie recipe? i'd like to learn how to make chewy c.c.cs.
ANSWERS: 
Use your hands, and some muscle too, to break the brown sugar apart as much as you can. Then for the big chunks, place in a bowl and microwave on high for a few seconds at a time.

recipe:
CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
Active time: 35 min Start to finish: 2 hr 
3 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 sticks (1 cup) unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly
1 1/2 cups packed light brown sugar
1 cup granulated sugar
3 large eggs
1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
2 1/2 cups semisweet chocolate chips (16 oz) 


 
Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375°F. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment or wax paper.
Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a small bowl. 

Beat together butter and sugars in a large bowl with an electric mixer at high speed until pale and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Lightly beat 1 egg with a fork in a small bowl and add 1 3/4 tablespoons of it plus 2 remaining whole eggs to butter mixture, beating with mixer until creamy, about 1 minute. Beat in vanilla. Reduce speed to low and mix in flour mixture until just blended, then stir in chips. 

Scoop 1/4 cup batter for each cookie, arranging mounds 3 inches apart, on 2 baking sheets. Flatten mounds into 3-inch rounds using moistened palm of your hand. Form remaining cookies on additional sheets of parchment. 

Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until golden, 13 to 15 minutes. Transfer cookies to a rack to cool and continue making cookies in same manner using cooled baking sheets. 

Cooks' note:
• Cooled cookies keep in an airtight container at room temperature 3 days.

Makes about 28 large (4 1/2-inch) cookies.
***
Toss the brown sugar in the microwave with a cup of water - put it on defrost or low for a few seconds, that should help ya.
***
Wet a paper towel and don't ring it out. Fold it and place it in the bag w/ the brown sugar. Close the bag almost all the way. Microwave for 20 seconds on medium. Flip it over, put the towel on the other side of the sugar, and do exactly the same thing. It should soften quite a bit that way.
***
break it apart the best you can than microwave it for 30 seconds in a microwave safe bowl.
***
microwave 10 seconds at a time until soft
***
just break it apart while its in the bag..just squish it
***
Takr her to dinner, have a couple of drinks, complement her on her dress, hair etc...
***
I do not know how to soften it, but for future reference .... to keep it soft keep a small piece of bread in the bag.
***
Add about 1 teaspoon of water per 1/2 cup and microwave on low for 30 seconds. This should do the trick. If you have time. Put brown sugar in a plastic ziploc bag and add about a tablespoon of water. Seal it and it should be nice and soft a few hours later.

QUESTION: i think i have a problem. i feel shy when i arrive at a gathering and say hello to people or guests.? i also feel the same when i leave. i feel like just leaving without saying goodbye cause i feel timid.? what should i do to overcome this?
ANSWERS: 
Nothing to be done accept forcing yourself to do it. Say Hello and enquire about their health too or just talk about something. Add appreciation of how nice the party was, how nice the person is looking or how nice it was to be there and meeting everybody with your goodbyes. Chatting more will help you distract your mind from your anxiety. After a few times, it will be easier.
***
HI friend !
Dont feel like that .
U can overcome this simple problem. Do one thing that go and stand infront of the mirror and practice before talking with others.
Do this u can overcome this problem

ok

bye
***
This is normal. Most ppl have this problem. Say hi to those who are having eye contact with you. Ignore those who are not looking at you. When you leave, just say goodbye to those who are noticing that you are leaving. But it's important to say goodbye to your host.
***
you need to build your confidence... try standing infront of a mirror (dont take it as a joke) for 15 mins, and talk with your self, take a book or something read it... look at you.. tell me results in 7 days.... email me at pakimran@yahoo.com
***
Tips: Always feel that you belong.
You've been invited so there's no reason to act awkward, there's nothing to worry about, you don't need to do extra motion but just plain simple greeting will do.
Be confident, it's all about mind-set.
***
First, give yourself a break.  You're haven't got a problem.  Lots of people get shy, even the people you might think are confident.  Don't be afraid to be yourself.  This doesn't mean to have an attitude that you don't care what people think, but don't be afraid to disagree with people sometimes.  If you've got trouble making small talk, you could even try practising with family or friends.  Finally, don't be scared to make a fool of yourself.  You rarely say something really stupid in conversation. Just laugh at yourself, people can't resist being attracted to some with a good sense of humour.  Just enjoy yourself!
***
take someone with you that is semi confident. Let them engage you in social encounters. It will help you become used to the extra attention you may receive.
***
Lots of people have this problem. I am one of them. I try to just MAKE myself do it because I know it's the polite thing to do. If I just really don't feel like talking I just walk up to them and shake their hand. Usually they will then say hello/goodbye and even though I didn't say anything out loud I feel I said a proper goodbye.
***
i think you just need to do it...
just force yourself to make introductions even tho you feel uncomfortable....with time it will become second nature to you
good luck!

QUESTION: i hve a lot of split ends.even trimming is of no use.pls advice.i want to have stronger and more b'ful hair.? when i was young i had areally thick and long hair.but the split ends hve ruined them.they have hindred growth of my hair.can any1 help??????
no stupid advices pls!
ANSWERS: 
You need to have all the split ends cut off by a professional.  No more dying or perming hair - If you want color try Henna - it's good stuff and is a great conditioner.  Don't brush your hair when wet - use only a wide toothed comb and use a good conditioner.  Get trims every 6 weeks and continue to be careful to your hair when wet.  Take prenatal vitamins and gelatin (Knox makes gelatin for hair and nails).  In about 3-6 months you will notice a major difference.  Good Luck.
***
A  deep conditioner is a must. I do not know if you live in England, but if you do then go to superdrugs, and buy the coconut intensive conditioner, for dry or damaged hair. Fantastic, also don't tie hair with elastic bands they have been known to cause split ends. Also no extra stress on you hair with rough handling, like giving your hair a real rough dry with the towel every time you have finished your hair is its most weakest then so be gentle, also try your best 2 stay away from blow drying and curlers and all That. After a while it will really trash your hair
***
Stay away from blow dryers, curling irons, flat irons, and any heated appliance. If you do use a heated appliance, find a thermal protectant spray to put on your hair before using it. Do not rub the towel on your hair to get it dry, pat it dry. Don't use a fine toothed comb on your wet hair either. Use a very good conditioner.
***
you need to take vitamins,  actually, I have one that says, Hair, skin & nails.  Do some research and find out what vitamins are for strong hair, then it wont split.
***
try starting over....cut your hair Short and take very good care of it, use a deep conditioner, and /or hot oil treatment often. don't put it up when wet and don't put a lot of heat on it.
***
don't tie it when it's wet and use conditioner and have a haircut instead
***
HOT OIL TREATMENT UNDER THE DRYER .. QUIT USING FLAT IRONS ,, CURLING IRONS , ALWAYS USE A PRODUCT THAT WILL PROTECT YOUR HAIR IF YOU BLOW DRY ,, PAUL MITCHELLS HEAT AND SEAL IS THE BEST ... DON'T BLOW DRY YOUR HAIR UP THE SHAFT , ALWAYS DOWN ,, ROOTS TO ENDS ... I YOU WANT CURL BUY A GOOD SET OF HOT ROLLERS . THIS STYLE IS THE HOTTEST THING THIS YEAR  ..

QUESTION: what is the best way u can make u'r husband get rid of his anger? my husband and i had a love marraige.though my husband loves me so much he has this short temper which makes him express anger very easily.otherwise he is a very good person
ANSWERS: 
Loving someone so much is not an excuse for anger.  This is a serious problem and may get worse with time.  The key is find out what is really behind his anger because it can't be his love for you.  He needs to accept responsiblity for his anger and make a choice to control it and do something about for the good of your relationship.  He may be able to do this with your help or he may need profesional help.  Either way change needs to happen because real love has no place for anger.
***
maybe he can get a hobby or even exercise to release stress or anger management classes.My husband is in the military and he was required to take classes because his job was stressful.
***
When you find the answer to this question let me know cause I need answer too.
***
Tell him to count to 100 before saying or doing anything-works for me
***
my husband has a stressful job and so has a short temper with all sorts of things at home.  All he does is take a multi vitamin everyday.  And then every day for about 2 weeks at a time and then with a 1 week break he takes a vitamin called St. Johns Wort. It really helps him to do this. Hope it helps you

QUESTION: i need some real help with understanding blogs? hopefully free sites 
where is the best place to go and learn,and start your own blog. i would like to do this but there are so many that i am just confuddled. i need total help on it....
ANSWERS: 
Start by first reading taking notes on the blogs that you like. Think about what you like about them, their style, and most importantly, their "voice". Then think about who you are writing for and what your audience would like to hear from you. It might be your family or just like minded people. Or, you may just want to have a place for self-expression. Don't over think it, but have some semblence of a plan before you start. 

As for the technology, I recommend trying the following (with a few pros/cons on each one). There's NO reason to have to pay for a blog, unless you want things like your own domain name or other advanced features. These are also all "hosted" services, which means you don't need to install any software on a server. 

- spaces.msn.com. This is a really simple, basic service offered by Microsoft's MSN. You can get started with the basics here and modify the look and feel whenever you like. The designs aren't the most sophisticated, but they give you a lot of options for publishing, from simply creating lists of your favorite stuff, to having a photo blog. Of course, you can also have a traditional text blog. It may be sufficient in the beginning, but depending on your level of expertise, you may outgrow it eventually. One nice benefit -- if you have a lot of MSN Messenger users in your network, you can set up a private blog that only they can access. 

- www.blogger.com. Owned by Google, this is also a nice simple service. The designs are great, the service is pretty basic though and lacks what I think is a key feature, categories that help organize your blog posts. I have to admit though that my personal blog is on this site, primarily because I like the templated designs and don't care that much about organizing my blog!

- livejournal.com. This is a great place to host a blog if you're focused on a tight circle of friends. You can restrict views, commenting, etc. to only your circle of trusted friends. 

- typepad.com. This service isn't free, but it has one really nice capability which is the ability to mask the URL so that it shows your own domain. This is pretty important because if you ever want to MOVE your blog and have built up a sizable readership, you'll want to be directly people to that personal domain. Typepad starts at $4.95 a month, which is "virtually" free. This is a great service which I use for my professional blog. 

Hope this helps, and blog on!

QUESTION: why claim to know what your talking about, when you don't...you know who you are..? i was just reading a question on vampires..in there someone had answered the question...they said they worked for a fictional mag for 10 years or some such...they also stated that witches worship the devil..this is so untrue..witches for your information don't believe in the devil..the devil is a christain thing, not a pagan thing...my question is, why would you state something you obviously know nothing about?...if you'd of said..."in your opinion"...that would be fine...but you lead ppl to believe you know what your talking about...when you don't!!! read this website if you'd like to know what witches believe..

www.witchesway.com
ANSWERS: 
Let's see, how many idiots are there on Yahoo Answers answering questions they know nothing about and asking really stupid questions (hmm?)? Do you really care? If it bothers you, you can always add a your own answer or vote or comment on the best answer when voting's over. But if it bothers you enough that you want to essentially spam everyone with it, then Yahoo Answers probably is not the place for you - we don't even get paid, who says they expect fully accurate and thoughtful information?

Otherwise, you're just making a big deal out of something you don't even consider that important (in which case I'll take a couple points). If that's the case, you are lying, which is just as bad as what you're complaining about.
Or do you just like the attention?
***
Hey, I resemble that remark.
***
a claim is nothing more than an assertion.  any assertion can be taken as true or false, like a contention.  if what i say or write is not sometning that i know... it should be taken as false.  But must i not say or write it to even know for myself if it is hogwash or heavenly.
***
Some people have an ego problem and want to appear superior to others. When actually them have low self esteem
***
So Your Claiming to be a "pagan"? Pagans have been around even since the early parts of the Old Testiment.... What a humor.
***
You're thinking about Wiccans.  We don't worship the devil but not all witches are Wiccan.  There are some witches who do worship the devil and there are others who don't.
***
Siht bicth, you really have no idea what you're on about, do you?
So reading a web-site makes you a fcuking professor then?

I have spoken so much siht you wouldn't believe, but at the end of the day, the siht I speak is down to life experiences.

Don't mean I'm right, but I'm honest (ish).

Give people a rest for Christ's sake
***
And your question is? Are you a witch?
***
You are right with most of what your are saying , but I have to ask you:
What did witches believe before www.witchesway.com and why  do you think they know what they are talking about? Opinions are just part of life and sometimes it is hard to tell what is Opinion and what is fact...
***
I had some what of the same arguement with someone last night....but they were talking about witchcraft and blackmagic are the samething and it is not....at least in my opinion
***
i don't know?
***
Because they like hearing themselves talk.

I keep saying that Satan is a Christian construct and that Pagans and witches do not worship him/it (minus Satanists which really do not worship the christian version-much-).

Brightest blessings to you.
***
Because everyone is stupid, and think that there opinion is right. Especially the relgious freaks. I've stated several times that Christianity was founded on Pagan beliefs, and in fact Christians are the ones who created the devil, and therefore are the only true ones that actually belive in the him, which is kinda of funny because they are what they hate. 

This is how the story goes (for those who don't know)
The Pagan religion was becoming very popular among everyone, is consisted of loving nature, having parties and feasts, pretty much loving every thing and enjoyinh life. They also have several different gods and goddesses. Then there were some people who didn't belive this was right (the christians) so the started telling people the the Pagans worship the devil (whcih they believed since the Pagan god is part goat) and they started converting people, which they  still try to do today. Most christian holidays were Pagan holidays that the christians stole. Christians are the ones that believe and worship satan, no one else.

QUESTION: what color or texture tie would go well with this suit (picture incl)? i'm trying to buy a tie for a friend that would go well with his pinstripe suit (with vest) [ http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v461/alternativeulster/uglytie.jpg ]. 
i'm just wondering what kind of color would go well. 
is it bad to mix textures or other stripes with this? what kind of tie would you recommend for this outfit? any and all input is appreciated (i really don't like that tie)! thanks.
ANSWERS: 
the tie i think goes well with the pin suit. so u dont have to buy another tie.
***
Depends. For the winter I would pick a darker color or if it is your guy pick a color that is in your dress. Since gray is the color it can go with pretty much anything. My favorite colors are blue and green so you can go with them as well.
***
Any color that isn't very loud would work just fine.
***
try going in for pinks reds or blues
***
IT DEPENDS ON THE COLOR OF THE SHIRT THAT HE IS GOING TO WEAR.HE MAY WEAR A SOLID POWDER BLUE.DARK GREY,OR A SOLID ORANGE SHIRT.WITH THE POWDER BLUE SHIRT I RECOMMEND A LITTLE DARKER SILK BLUE TIE,DARK GREY SHIRT I RECOMMEND A DARK GREY SILK TIE,WITH THE ORANGE SHIRT I RECOMMEND A DARK ORANGE SILK TIE.THE PINSTRIPE SUIT IS BUSY ENOUGH SO I WOULD STAY AWAY FROM PRINTS OR DESIGNS IT MAY CLASH OR MAY LOOK TO BUSY.

QUESTION: are you or do you know someone who still has their wisdom teeth? what are they for. i didn't start getting mine until i was 21. now i'm 23 and one of them has not even shown signs of coming in. i'm going to the dentist next week. i just wanted to know if any of you know what they are for, and why so many people have them cut out?
ANSWERS: 
most people have them cut out due to not having enough room in their mouth and the pain is causes some people. I had all mine in at 14 and they never once gave me a problem ( guess some of us have bigger mouths LOL). They serve the same purpose as all the other teeth. But in reality most have them cut out due to not having enough room for them to grow without pushing the other teeth crooked.
***
Yes.
***
Most people get wisdom teeth removed because there's simply not enough room in their mouth for the teeth to grow in healthily.  I'm lucky in that I don't have nor have I ever had wisdom teeth - a dentist of mine joked that I was more highly evolved than most people.

Usually the wisdom teeth grow in crooked or are too hard to maintain and get cavities easily - my fiance's about to get his yanked (he's 33 and has had them since about 20) because they finally started to hurt - he then noticed that one of them was basically starting to turn black . . . I guess if you can't really see them and they don't really hurt you don't realize they're going bad.  When one of them is removed the mate on the bottom must be removed as well - I'm not sure why, I think it has something to do with keeping your bite even.

Wisdom teeth aren't really for anything in particular - they come in during adolescence, generally, so they're called "wisdom" teeth because they come in when a person is becoming more of an adult.  Sometimes they grow into the sinus cavities and cause problems, sometimes they grow in sideways and cause problems . . . mostly they just make the rest of your teeth get crooked as they grow in and then they start going bad because you can't brush them properly.
***
My mom still has hers. I think that she would rather have had them out because it is kind of hard to floss.

I had mine taken out, not enough room.
***
i still have mine and i'm 30, i have never had any problems from them at all, they get pulled out if they are causing problems like constant caries, abcesses or are partially erupted and impacted at the same time, they are use for grinding the foods that we eat down. so if you are not having any problems with them there is no need to have them extracted, just keep brushing flossing and using interdental brushes if you have the space between them and you should have them untill the day you die.
***
My wisdom teeth started coming in during my late teens and still hadn't finished growing in by my early 20's. Mine had to be cut out because the roots were attached to my jaw bone. Having them removed isn't as bad as you think it might be.
***
I think people get them taken out because they are hard to brush, not sure about that though! I have no idea what they are for either..

QUESTION: what can i do..?¿? i'm 17, engaged, have a child, homeschooled, no job, and my fiance starts a new job on monday. i hate living at home, b/c it's not big enough for two families. i feel like a caged animal. does anyone have any advice on what i can do..?¿ i live in ohio if that helps.

!!mature answers only..!!
ANSWERS: 
Sorry i just wanted to no how to do the upside down ?
***
i am 17, home schooled, no job and also live in Ohio. i am always at home it drives me CRAZY. i kind of have a lot of family drama which makes it worst. i am in a venture crew so on Tuesdays i get out of the house, thank god. i totally know what your saying
***
Please don't capitalize every letter, just the first in each sentence and proper nouns. Thank you.

I suggest you start looking for a job. Find a sitter or leave your kid with your parents while you look. Start saving up your money so that you can find an apartment soon. If your parents have enough, ask them for a loan to get started. Good luck!
***
ok u are almost married have a child but no job but your husband to be does ok. I think its only fair that u get to move out bc U have your own family which qualifies u to have your own life. SO i think it is com pletely fair to move out. ANd what the heck are u doing living with your grandparents, and married. Th only thing is your homeschooled u need to go to real school so if u went to a real school yes I say its competely fair. its kind of fair to have to live in your grand parents house
***
Get a job and get responsible.  Being engaged at 17 is insane.  Don't count on a man to support you.  Go find some work and collect child support.
***
start saving I guess. thats about it. 






live long and prosper
***
as a mother, you have the right to be emancipated. If the problem is just space and privacy, I would try to stick it out. Rent, food, daycare, they are all more expensive then you think. 

Do you have your High school diploma? If so, see about taking soem classes at the local community college. It would make you more attractive to the job market and get you out of the house every day. See is Srs will cover daycare while you are in training. 

If you really can't handle staying there, then get into some low income houseing and plan on getting a job. It'll be stressfull, but you have to do what you feel is best for your family.
***
I know how you feel.  My husband lost his job during my 3rd trimester and we moved in with his family for a few months until we got back on our feet.  8 people under one roof is not a pretty thing!  The best thing to do is to try your best to save up and hopefully within a couple of months you guys should have enough to move out.  See if there are any odd jobs, things like that that perhaps your parents can give you some money for.  Also, in the mean time start planning.  Get an idea of how much a two bedroom apartment or house will cost to rent.  Then calculate additional fees such as application fees, security deposits and things like that.  This way you can better calculate how much you'll need to move out.  How old is your fiance?  Does he have any credit?  If neither of you have credit or renter's history then you'll have to ask your parents to co-sign so remind them that it's helping them too by moving out.  If you can get a part-time job without having to pay for someone to watch your child then by all means you should totally go for it.  With the extra money you bring in, that means it'll be faster moving out.  Best of luck!
***
you need to get a job, and then you and your fiance need to find your own place.  very good luck to you =)
***
You could get a job and save up to get a place of your own.  That's about all I can think of.

BTW how fo you make an upside down -?- ?

QUESTION: should we be friends again? okay, i am a senior at ocean bay high school in california. i have had a best friend for like 15  or 16  years. last year, she started to ignore me. pretty soon i started hanging out with some other people. for about a month we were vicious enemies and she spread like a hundred rumors about me. some time has past where we haven't really talked. (except when she prank calls... i know its so 3rd grade.) she found out that i was having a party at the end of the year and asks if she is invited. part of me wants to invite her and part of me wants to not trust her. what do you think i should do? this sounds a little first grade, but its not and i am so confused. my friend told me that i should post my question on here so i did. help!?
ANSWERS: 
You should do what you think is right!!!   IF you two have been best friends for a long time and just recently this started to happen then i would just give it some time.   The party if you know that she or he is that kind of person who would just try to humiliate you in front of alot of peoplet then don't invite her/him.   IF you really would want to be friend again then ive it some time.   If the rumors have gone too far then just forget about this person and continue to hang out with the new friends you got!!!   Just try talking and if that don't work than what else will???
***
she will probably end up ruining your party or starting a cat fight that's what happens at all my friends parties she really shoudln't expect to be invited after all she has put you through just ignore her and stick with your new friends
***
I think u shld because uve been friends forever and u shld try to get her back. Ask her wats her problem and she should be up to it.
***
MAYBE this is ur chance to start being friends again but then maybe she want to just f**k up ur party ! do what ur heart tells u ! the first thing that comes to mind take it dont ingore it !
***
I don't think so.  It's very hard to put all that stuff behind you and from experience I know how hurtful that can be. If you have new friends then you have proved to her that you do not need her, and she has absolutely no right whatsoever to expect an invitation to your party. As cutie pie says, she could end up causing a fight, which would ruin your party and upset you more than you have already been.

QUESTION: how can i love? i cant help my self to speaking to girlz but i cant find the right one help me

or if u r a girl with the same problem may be u wanna talk
ANSWERS: 
When you meet the right person you'll forget about being nervous. Jus try not to think about what to say to girls, just relax more and be yourself.
..
***
You'll now when you've met the right one.....it may take a while, but it'll be worth it!
***
well seems you need to spell girls right and maybe the right one will come along.
'Ladies are delicate creatures .
you have the rest of your life and before you know it lady love will come your way. why rush it. make sure she is the right one first.
***
These things take time - if you're continually searching for love you'll never find it. Sit back enjoy being single and stop putting pressure on yourself and you'll meet someone. People are alot more attractive if they don't appear clingy/desparate and are just relaxed and comfortable with who they are
***
i can love by listening to them coz listening is one of the most important thing that we can heard bout what they feel towards each other
***
well girl i am but e-mail me if u want but dunno how it would help, but if it will then mail me or leave a comment on my 360 ok byeee
***
It takes a long time to find the one you love. If you got it right the 1st time you wouldn't appreciate it as much. Keep on searching and don't give up. x
***
Try not to focus on the exterior and focus more on whats inside the person.Beauty fades.
***

***
You really are too young to worry about this. Just see girls as friends, when the time is right you'll know.
***
Just relax and when you meet the right girl you will know.
***
not suprised if you talk in textspeak all of the time
***
when you meet her your heart starts beating quicker.  when you feel the happiest person in the world when you kiss her. just look into her eyes and you'll find an answer. i wish you good luck.
there's one saying: love it is a state when your brain doesn't think. whan your eyes don't see and only heart....it is beating, beating.....

QUESTION: my guy tells me he loves me but?!? ok my guy is a bit more than a few years older than me so i dont get too see him as often as i would like and i love him soo much but the problem is is that he tells me he loves me but a "friend" told me that he told her that he told sum girl that he loved her so what the hell is up with that and its like he ignores me when hes home and its very hard to get ahold of him anybody know whats up???
ANSWERS: 
he's fooling around.. maybe he has a very big heart 2 accommodate alot of ladies..

girl, wake up & dump him b4 he dumps u 4 somebody's a**
***
He is playing you.  Trust me.
***
He's such a player (i think).
He's bad
***
if you really love him as you believe, ask him, make him tell you the truth, although i think he is playing you,
***
Stop listening to all your friends...And take a breather for a little bit.  Maybe he's feeling just a tad suffocated at the moment.
***
It really sounds as if he's hooking up with more than one person and he's not being honest with you. It seems as if he's dating a lot of women at the same time and you're just one of them. I'm sorry to say. And he uses the 'I love you' line to get women obviously. So, my advice is leave him. There are pleny more fish in the sea. Go find someone who genuinely loves you and won't go around loving other girls.
***
Hes such a flirt and he LOVES any other female creatures. Get rid of him before he hurts you more deeper!!! You can find someone better than this jerk.
***
He is using you. Are you over twelve? God!.
***

he loves both of you; and I am sure he can , most men have lots of loving to spread around!
***

hey girl i no its hard but i really dont htink he is worth your time. u have better things to do than worry about what hes doin behind ur back. and you no u should stink with some1 who has all the tim in the world for u.

                           -good luck
***
There's nothing wrong with loving more then one woman at a time.  Especially if it's at the same exact time.
***
Dear friend, You know your friend that told you what he said might be lying. Think about it! Best thing to do is comfront your guy with this question, remember communication is essential in a relationship right along with love and trust. You'll never know till you ask him about the other girl. Watch out for warning signs too! Have a great day and keep on searching til you find the truth. GOOD LUCK
***
if you can't get ahold of him and there are romers out about him do what your heart tells you to do leave him you don't need to be no ones fool.love means legs open very easy.take that and run with it.
***
Definitely not interested in you well enough to get in contact with you. Find yourself someone that will respect you and treat you like you deserve. Now if you think leftovers is all you are worth receiving then stay with him. 

be wise girl,
***
have faith or just live it but first talk to him

THAT GUY OF YOURS IS LIKE A ROLLING STONE.SOMETIMES ROLLING TO YOU AND SOMETIMES TO ANOTHER WOMAN.ITS TIME YOU KICKED HIM OUT OF YOUR LIFE BEFORE HE CRUSHES YOUR HEART.

QUESTION: so anybody answer about weight? im 150 pounds and i work out everyday im 5feet 6 inches and im 14 yrs old
im i good to go or should i lose weight
ANSWERS: 
You're about 5 lbs over your ideal weight based on the assumption that you have a medium frame.
***
Just keep working out and eating right and you will be fine - at your age you will burn off calories.
***
Following a regular exercise program and eating a healthy diet will naturally give you your personal ideal weight. Don't worry about weight on a scale instead find out your body fat % and base your health on that. Weighing more or less than someone else at the same height does not mean that you are more or less healthy. It is the amount of lean muscle mass that distinguishes a healthy physique
